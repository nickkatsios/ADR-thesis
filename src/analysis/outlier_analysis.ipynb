          "konduit serving packaging system proposed alex black discussed sam paul konduit serving complex modular tool intended deployed number different configuration multiple packaging format given modelpipeline deploymentpackaging scenario vary widely example user might want deploy tensorflow model via konduit serving one configuration many docker image packaging tensorflow cuda linux arm system serving via httprest selfcontained exe embedded jvm samediff tensorflow import run model cpu window avx system intel mkl mkldnn onednn included serving performed via grpc currently packaging konduit serving done via maven profile maven module user selects combination dopendencies functionality enabling number profile system property example building window cpu uber jar look something like mvn clean package dskiptests puberjar pcpu ppython pnative ppmml ptensorflow dchipcpu djavacppplatformwindowsx packaging executed adding different profile approach got quite far term packaging enabling flexible packaging including uberjars docker war debrpms tar file exe file running limit approach specifically approach following problem combination available user going continue grow many profile combination devsusers know understand combination difficult impossible profile property example building binary window linux mac ppc etc easy leave performance table ndjsamedifftensorflow etc binary built without avx support many incompatibility become apparent runtime example build cuda version find tensorflow release cuda hence runtime problem dataapi rewrite configuration execution separate one configuration run many different way example tensorflow model could run tensorflow samediff tvm possibly automated conversion onnx etc challenging support via profile property build approach usability issue example user know lot different profile configuration etc get optimal even functional deployment even know possible example user might build uberjar without pmml profile enabled discover jar cant run pipeline pmml model packaging custom code dependency asset inc model vocabulary file etc difficult impossible present building konduit serving artifact uberjars docker image etc requires cloning main source code repo though hide automatically case python clibased source build proposal scope proposal limited creationpackaging konduit serving uberjar may deployed many form docker rpm war etc note nonjava packagingdeployments pipeline scope deploy pure binary osgi support relevant scope extent osgibased system could work build top functionality described proposal proposal goal goal packaging proposal follows retain enhance existing deployment uberjar docker war exe etc remove reliance build source constructing konduit serving artifact enable greater flexibility builddeployment configuration enable custom java python code dependency easily included deployment improve usability reliability packaging following way remove reliance maven profile property least executing build automate selection recommendation module include given pipeline look pipeline config find whats necessaryuseful include add validation checking common pitfall dependency issue incompatible cpu architecture wrong cuda version etc make clear user requirement term hardware software satisfied deployment system requires cuda java etc proposal overview proposal number part build tool top gradle via buildgradlekts generation utilizes configuration format actually perform required build konduit serving build configuration format command line tool creating build configuration user pipeline necessary triggering build based generated build configuration file system packaging custom java code dependency note usability possible well make user doesnt aware build configuration file example simple cli might configure execute build cli would generate configuration pas build tool without user aware configuration file however advanced user case system administrator devops etc allow configuration file written modified directly outside cliui workflow user part build tool given configuration file specifies included build detail later build tool execute build necessary create requested artifact jar docker image etc note term build tool may ideal name proposed tool simply thin layer top maven comparable true build tool like maven gradle ant etc note also principle though proposed right multiple build tool creating final artifact configuration definition build tool build execution separate look pure deployment main possible second build tool would osgibased deployment however would still maven based proposed build tool generate execute via gradle buildgradlekts file based configuration file similar current module profile approach continue maven plugins actual packaging creation uberjars etc generated buildgradlekts file include repository section repository mavencentral plugin section plugins java dependency section listing direct dependency required konduit serving module konduitservingtensorflow konduitservingndj etc native library backend dependency ndj nativecuda backends example logging etc dependency property sourcecompatibility targetcompatibility section necessary creating build artifact docker image war file etc utility task enforcing dependency convergence etc one consequence packaging module would removed favor single konduitservingbuild module konduitservingdocker konduitservingrpm konduitservinguberjar etc longer exist future likely allow build tool create multiple different artifact based one configuration file one uberjar user target platform output example separate jar file one linux linux armhf window usability perspective note user usually wont interact build tool directly instead touching aware uicli layer top gradle maven near term either tool gradle maven adequate implementing proposal build tool maven advantage something team currently experience however gradle seems edge two respect build speedperformance httpsgradleorgmavenvsgradle extensibilityflexibility including coding directly buildgradle file plan proceed gradle result major blockes either switch add parallel implementation based maven gradle kotlin instead groovy generated build file practice wont make much difference build configuration generated written hand kotlin provide benefit groovy better ide support due static typing hence get benefit autocompletion easy navigation source easier refactoring etc work generated buildgradlekts file directly part configuration file configuration file provide information necessary determine build via generated buildgradlekts file set direct dependency plugins property profile end following information included part configuration konduit serving module include konduit serving version optional default latest specified deployment packaging type uberjar docker etc associated configuration deployment target architecture cpu gpu etc selected preferred pipeline step runner one exists one included pipeline step information necessary package required externalcustom code dependency file resource etc additional dependency configuration override dependency management exclusion etc metadata timestamps comment author etc jsonyaml proposed format build configuration file part cli cli build tool one way user configure build required deployment artifact uberjar docker image etc internally usually without user aware cli tool create build configuration pas build tool execution two mode operation proposed cli command line style wizard style command line style provide information necessary produce configuration file short form exact configuration designed detail later likely look something like following bash konduitbuild mypipelinejson module tensorflowndjimage deploy docker dockerconfig namexversiony incudejava comcompanymylibrary wizard style cli guide user selecting pipeline term implementation priority implementation command line style specific design worked suggested usage look something like following konduitbuild konduit serving build tool enter path pipeline json yml file ctrlc exit myfileyml select deployment environment comma space delimited case insensitive linux window mac osx lahf linux arm armhf linux arm arm lla wizard style would output command line style command entered optionally configuration file would execute build based configuration part build build would simple singlepage nothing fancy feature rich near term focused three thing guiding user configuration process pipeline main goal show user required module serving pipeline customing deployment target platform selected model runner configure step etc creating configuration file though would implemented backend based user selects via triggering build based generated configuration file user able load previouslycreated build configuration file partially completely specified starting point pipeline build later may add way visualize create pipeline configuration also look would separate adr proposed starting stopping build straightforward assuming user konduit python package similar installed konduitbuildui konduit serving build launched httpslocalhost ctrlc exit workflow would user would something like launch konduitbuildui select konduit serving pipeline deploy later allow generic model similar selection instead providing pipeline configuration select deployment environment cpu architecture cpu gpu avx support etc later device profile select pipeline step runner multiple available example running tensorflow model whether samediff tvm etc run model optionally add custom java code python code dependency java codedependencies simple specifying gav coordinate user project python packaging dependency tbd may something like directory requirementstxt optionally embed filesresources deployment artifact including model file required select packaging uberjar docker exe etc selected show configuration relevant packaging click verify check produce final report would check dependency estimate final file size verify binary compatibility etc necessary prompt user thing explicitly approve example necessary accepting license party software bundled click build execute build would pas configuration build tool create final artifact uberjars docker image etc point user would able save current configuration yamljson file load back later stage would allow user select consistent previous choice still visible grayed step regarding device profile idea would allow user select thing like raspberry jetson nano generic linux possibly even common cloud vms reduce amount knowledgeconfiguration required create pipeline part pipeline analysis module selection important component cli would determining konduit serving module included execute pipeline available runner could execute step contained within nearterm could add something semiautomatically trackaggregate execution supportcapabilities across module wed build mapping module name rather pipelinesteprunners pipelinestep configuration run basic version especially difficult idea would encode information like samediffpipelinesteprunner module konduitservingsamediff execute step type tensorflowpipelinestep advanced version actually check configuration would added later samediffpipelinesteprunner run tensorflow model well check configuration time one thing keep mind extensibility example one day might custom pipeline step available via konduit serving hub codedependencies custom pipeline step could pulled automatically however substantially alter basic approach analysismodule selection principle simply adding external web lookup step determine run given step part customexternal java code dependency pipeline user want write custom java code example custom pipeline step custom metric etc custom java code dependency direct transitive also included built jar easy system including code dependency konduit serving pipeline java proposal handling trivially simple user package code standard maven project user mvn install project including custom code local maven repository note uberjar standard modulejar direct transitive dependency fine user specify gav coordinate group artifact version custom functionality configuration file likely via cliui additional possible mechanism could added later would provide way building github repository clone install add konduit serving deployment would doable couple line configuration could useful cicd based pipeline install provide gav approach also work fine osgibased buildsdeployments future future adrs number aspect packaging system would worked future adrs adrs may may produced following component configuration format design

dropbox user able select projection imagery receive data model choosing appropriate internal data representation export parameter important ideally would like single export process handle exporting imagery tool node project want process easy reason well resilient change tool project user dont lot information actual usage pattern functionality look like beta user band rgbnir imagery however know many beta user expressed pressing able view imagery map exporting result analysis urgent many focus immediate development effort providing solution user want export rgb imagery project already contain rgb band little analysis alteration aside color correction mosaicking approach constrain scope development allow iterate quickly addressing concrete problem faced real user put another way explicitly deferring implementation export functionality following case falsecolor composite hyperspectral nonrgb data source project whose scene dont available band resolution tool output arbitrary tool node however expect cover deferred case sooner rather later design data model way believe allow easily expand export functionality going forward detail design given additionally order avoid making functionality limited information aspect functionality outlined addressed adr noted end section data model internally wrap export configuration inside tool definition even though initial focus providing export rgb data project mean user request export particular project without colorcorrection internally generate oneoff tool look something like following export output tool project user

relate history datetime api evolution jvm new java datetime api introduced java big step forward explicitness correctness unfortunately api quite complex requires careful study correctly moreover adding database picture make thing even difficult since additional player like jdbc driver orm framework like hibernate database new player idea nuance datetime handling dealing timestamps application database utc zone standard best practice sensible approach ideally neither application database depend anymore local time zone execute freely move executables time zone quite common today cloud era always function correctly furthermore utc additional advantage primary time standard base reference regulates world clock time stable since never change daylight saving time dst standard textual representation parsable platform without ambiguity modeling utc timestamps application level java datetime api class represent utc timestamp javatimeinstant instant represents single moment specific point time utc timeline therefore misinterpreted confused moment history short simplest probably best choice model utc timestamps application level javatimeoffsetdatetime offsetdatetime perceived instant generalization offsetdatetime also model single moment time also includes configurable offset relative utc therefore offsetdatetime offset logical equivalent instant javatimelocaldatetime localdatetime often misused modeling utc timestamps problem localdatetime represent single moment time rather represents wallclock time always highly coupled time zone conceptual wallclock running

avoided modeling utc timestamps also zoneddatetime class brings nuance time zone handling real world example zoneddatetime handle daylight saving time dst including tracking latest political conceptually however zoneddatetime instant assigned zoneid best choice storing utc timestamps might handy case like presenting timestamp user time zone reason described choosing javatimeinstant modeling utc timestamps let discus hibernate handle instant utc timestamps hibernate timestamp column following discussion assume postgresql database usage corresponding jdbc driver internal working might different database general mechanism quite similar mapping instant database hibernate javasqltimestamp writing database hibernate convert instant javasqltimestamp pass timestamp jdbc driver default hibernate via preparedstatementsettimestampint timestamp method mechanism offsetdatetime localdatetime note also appropriate preparedstatementsettimestampint timestamp calendar method hibernate unless explicitly configure time zone hibernate communicating database next jdbc driver convert javasqltimestamp string representation last part string time zone offset since settimestamp method two parameter explicit time zone provided jdbc driver local application time zone calculate offset although may look like local time zone cause issue still good path problem really happens targeted database column accept time zone offset information timestamp column case offset part string simply discarded loss time zone offset leading cause problem written local application timestamp database reading database hibernate resultsetgettimestampstring method also resultsetgettimestampstring calendar method unless explicitly configure hibernate therefore jdbc driver interpret fetched string database timestamp local application time zone finally hibernate convert passed timestamp instant via epoch second hand instant application ironically everything seems work correctly application perspective wrong timestamp written database application work right well work move another time zone happens previously recorded timestamps invalid application perspective new one stored

timestamp column even move application andor database time zone continue work correctly drawback still remain first dont setup work timestamptz timestamp column avoid possible second kind database viewer tool timestamptz column display data local time zone database data correct includes offset always convert utc head finally rely direct query execution without hibernate jdbc driver mediation

current record batch record approach however write converter utility tofrom data worse current tofrom record conversion however discussion micro service deployment remote endpoint background planned allow single konduitserving deployment spread along multiple container case wed like ship something already existing deployed service effectively becomes sort rpc call yes split multiple container something well frequently deployment situation require consider example following scenario pipeline model face detector run edge device powerful face verification model run powerful remote server idea edge device initial detection face detected pas data remote server cant andor dont want run entire pipeline one machine pipeline requires multiple docker container isolation cant embed every language ksjava like python case well split thing multiple docker container matlab swift etc come mind thing might deploy separate docker image even image run one machine situation nonlinear scaling pipeline step example first step filtering like face detection example multicore cpu machine filtering case actually make one gpu machine deployment cpu gpu gpu arent something right think inevitable well run deployment scenario current single process monolithic design wont work schema validation wouldnt possible make step queryable input output want definition time checker schema validation would quite nice guess could added another step doesnt built right thats bad idea would optional step really know inputsoutputs runtime inputsoutputs dynamic wont though example model step wont know placeholderinput name even number inputsoutputs load specific model yes let revisit metadata like input meta data available step wouldnt nice meta data addable step yes dont think covered something like mind example image loading step could return metadata original image format dimension filename etc back user matter many step present image loading step mapping model step end acknowledge naming

goal serverside manifest cli know little possible content manifest refactor deliberate departure goal order apply flag override cli must parse almost entire manifest risk serverside manifest wanted allow capi introduce new manifest property could leveraged user manifest without requiring code change cli biggest risk refactor capi could make change manifest specification would break user push experience cli release new version mitigation accept risk described reason designed cli new manifest parser preserve unrecognized yaml property inmemory representation yaml sent along api end mean capi free make additive change manifest specification user leverage without needing cli change capi make breaking change manifest specification impact cli however discussed capi team unlikely anytime

quota manifest would applied successfully apply manifest succeeded separate api call would apply flag override allot per instance instead however case push would fail error indicating desired memory quota however instance created would stick around despite failed push refactor push transforms inmemory representation manifest following yaml application name dora instance memoryinmb push would apply manifest would fail validation error indicating desired memory quota therefore never even get step scaling app instance fewer api request per app nice sideeffect refactor number api call required push app decrease considerably previously apply manifest property make one call apply manifest call app pushing roughly number flag override make one call apply manifest pushed apps mean push faster resilient flaky network connection likely fail middle due poor connection requires code implement maintainability refactor build hexagonal architecture established push refactor make push consistent easier reason diff possibility simpler path towards implementing diff output feature representation full desired manifest flag override applied make request api current manifest compare two

enabling flexible packaging including uberjars docker war debrpms tar file exe file running limit approach specifically approach following problem combination available user going continue grow many

implementation based maven gradle kotlin instead groovy generated build file practice wont make much difference build configuration generated written hand kotlin provide benefit groovy better ide

dependency management exclusion etc metadata timestamps comment author etc jsonyaml proposed format build configuration file part cli cli build tool one way user configure build required deployment artifact uberjar docker image etc internally usually without user aware cli tool create build configuration pas build tool execution two mode operation proposed cli command line style wizard style command line style provide information necessary produce configuration file short form exact configuration designed detail later likely look something like following bash konduitbuild mypipelinejson module tensorflowndjimage deploy docker dockerconfig namexversiony incudejava comcompanymylibrary wizard style cli guide user selecting pipeline term implementation priority implementation command line style specific design worked suggested usage look something like following konduitbuild konduit serving build tool enter path pipeline json yml file ctrlc exit myfileyml select deployment environment comma space delimited case insensitive linux window mac osx lahf linux arm armhf linux arm arm lla wizard style would output command line style command entered optionally configuration file would execute build based configuration part build build would simple singlepage nothing fancy feature rich near term focused three thing guiding user configuration process pipeline main goal show user required module serving pipeline customing deployment target platform selected model runner configure step etc creating configuration file though would implemented backend based user selects via triggering build based generated configuration file user able load previouslycreated build configuration file partially completely specified starting point pipeline build later may add way visualize create pipeline configuration also look would separate adr proposed starting stopping build straightforward assuming user konduit python package similar installed konduitbuildui konduit serving build launched httpslocalhost ctrlc exit workflow would user would something like launch konduitbuildui select konduit serving pipeline deploy later allow generic model similar selection instead providing pipeline configuration select deployment environment cpu architecture cpu gpu avx support etc later device profile select pipeline step runner multiple available example running tensorflow model whether samediff tvm etc run model optionally add custom java code python code dependency java codedependencies simple specifying gav coordinate user project python packaging dependency tbd may something like directory requirementstxt optionally embed filesresources deployment artifact including model file required select packaging uberjar docker exe etc selected show configuration relevant packaging click verify check produce final report would check dependency estimate final file size verify binary compatibility etc necessary prompt user thing explicitly approve example necessary accepting license party software bundled click build execute build would pas configuration build tool create final artifact uberjars docker image etc point user would able save current configuration yamljson file load back later stage would allow user select consistent previous choice still visible grayed step regarding device profile idea would allow user select thing like raspberry jetson nano generic linux possibly even common cloud vms reduce amount knowledgeconfiguration required create pipeline part pipeline analysis module selection important component cli would determining konduit serving module included execute pipeline available runner could execute step contained within nearterm could add something semiautomatically trackaggregate execution supportcapabilities across module wed build mapping module name rather pipelinesteprunners pipelinestep configuration run basic version especially difficult idea would encode information like samediffpipelinesteprunner module konduitservingsamediff execute step type tensorflowpipelinestep advanced version actually check configuration would added later samediffpipelinesteprunner run tensorflow model well check configuration time one thing keep mind extensibility example one day might custom pipeline step available via konduit serving hub codedependencies custom pipeline step could pulled automatically however substantially alter basic approach analysismodule selection principle simply adding external web lookup step determine run given step part customexternal java code dependency pipeline user want write custom java code example custom pipeline step custom metric etc custom java code dependency direct transitive also included built jar easy system including code dependency konduit serving pipeline java proposal handling trivially simple user package code standard maven project user mvn install project including custom code local maven repository note uberjar standard modulejar direct transitive dependency fine user specify gav coordinate group artifact version custom functionality configuration file likely via cliui additional possible mechanism could added later would provide way building github repository clone install add konduit serving deployment would doable couple line configuration could useful cicd based pipeline install provide gav approach also work fine osgibased buildsdeployments future future adrs number aspect packaging system would worked future adrs adrs may may produced following component configuration format design custom python code dependency embedding architecture compatibility checking dependency native code include dependency actually work arm ppcle etc fileresource embedding usability isuses user pipeline

user experience ide support shouldnt matter maven gradle one benefit alex either building overseeing team generally maven experience also necessarily eitheror could maven gradle build tool

relate history datetime api evolution jvm new java datetime api introduced java big step forward explicitness correctness unfortunately api quite complex requires careful study correctly moreover adding database picture make thing even difficult since additional player like jdbc driver orm framework like hibernate database new player idea nuance datetime handling dealing timestamps application database utc zone standard best practice sensible approach ideally neither application database depend anymore local time zone execute freely move executables time zone quite common today cloud era always function correctly furthermore utc additional advantage primary time standard base reference regulates world clock time stable since never change daylight saving time dst standard textual representation parsable platform without ambiguity modeling utc timestamps application level java datetime api class represent utc timestamp javatimeinstant instant represents single moment specific point time utc timeline therefore misinterpreted confused moment history short simplest probably best choice model utc timestamps application level javatimeoffsetdatetime offsetdatetime perceived instant generalization offsetdatetime also model single moment time also includes configurable offset relative utc therefore offsetdatetime offset logical equivalent instant javatimelocaldatetime localdatetime often misused modeling utc timestamps problem localdatetime represent single moment time rather represents wallclock time always highly coupled time zone conceptual wallclock running depending time zone stand different moment simultaneously course attached utc time zone strong relation local time zone always pop one way usage might considered advantage localdatetime generally avoided modeling utc timestamps also zoneddatetime class brings nuance time zone handling real world example zoneddatetime handle daylight saving time dst including tracking latest political conceptually however zoneddatetime instant assigned zoneid best choice storing utc timestamps might handy case like presenting timestamp user time zone reason described choosing javatimeinstant modeling utc timestamps let discus hibernate handle instant utc timestamps hibernate timestamp column following discussion assume postgresql database usage corresponding jdbc driver internal working might different database general mechanism quite similar mapping instant database hibernate javasqltimestamp writing database hibernate convert instant javasqltimestamp pass timestamp jdbc driver default hibernate via preparedstatementsettimestampint timestamp method mechanism offsetdatetime localdatetime note also appropriate preparedstatementsettimestampint timestamp calendar method hibernate unless explicitly configure time zone hibernate communicating database next jdbc driver convert javasqltimestamp string representation last part string time zone offset since settimestamp method two parameter explicit time zone provided jdbc driver local application time zone calculate offset although may look like local time zone cause issue still good path problem really happens targeted database column accept time zone offset information timestamp column case offset part string simply discarded loss time zone offset leading cause problem written local application timestamp database reading database hibernate resultsetgettimestampstring method also resultsetgettimestampstring calendar method unless explicitly configure hibernate therefore jdbc driver interpret fetched string database timestamp local application time zone finally hibernate convert passed timestamp instant via epoch second hand instant application ironically everything seems work correctly application perspective wrong timestamp written database application work right well work move another time zone happens previously recorded timestamps invalid application perspective new one stored shifted relative old one word application data invalid timestamp timestamptz standard sql data type timestamp commonly misused column intended store utc timestamps unfortunately timestamp sql data type cannot keep time zone offset information evident consider full name timestamp without time zone database support always sql type timestamp time zone preserve time zone offset postgresql timestamp stand timestamp without time zone data type timestamptz describes timestamp time zone going postgresql data type name brevity avoid problem described previous section simply timestamptz column instead timestamp column even move application andor database time zone continue work correctly drawback still remain first dont setup work timestamptz timestamp column avoid possible second kind database viewer tool timestamptz column display data local time zone database data correct includes offset always convert utc head finally rely direct query execution without hibernate jdbc driver mediation database display result local time zone example postgresql internally store timestamptz utc format however display direct query purpose always convert utc timestamp local time zone database displaying result fixing inconsistency fix issue timestamp column instructing hibernate utc time zone handling timestamps leverage hibernatejdbctimezone configuration property example spring boot application put following line applicationproperties file springjpapropertieshibernatejdbctimezoneutc configuration set hibernate settimestamp gettimestamp method calendar parameter calendar instance created configured utc time zone avoid issue direct query data display database management tool configure utc database default time zone exact procedure highly dependent concrete database postgresql examine supportdockerpostgrespostgresqlconf supportdockerdockercomposeinfrastructureyml file klokwrkproject one thing aware database management tool exploring data tool correctly display content timestamptz column experience pgadmin idea database tool work correctly dbeaver configure utc local time zone case dbvisualizer currently support distinguishing timestamp timestamptz column unfortunately display format data type architectural system klokwrkproject following recommendation handling utc timestamps javatimeinstant type modeling utc timestamps configure hibernate utc time zone handling javasqltimestamp via hibernatejdbctimezone configuration property configure default time zone database utc time zone postgresql timestamptz sql data type utc timestamp column consequence positive consistent correct unambiguous handling utc timestamps system level obvious timestamp represents much harder misinterpret timestamp anything else utc timestamp neutral requires minimal change

however arbitrarily extending possible raised case error processing response frontend act depending error code defining result type description text condition necessary approach convenient default

error come query attached entity actually encoded schema client decides error care error ignore client query query different result decides whats important detail approach taken ariadne documentation adaption discussion discouraged main error field convey error since message present key technical nature shouldnt displayed end user instead one define custom result type including field data case success error case failure set mutually exclusive graphql type query userid userresult type mutation createuserinput createuserinput userresult type userresult user user nonexisting user invalid input user name user organisation missing permission arguably could custom error type like error string depending success failure mutation resolver may return either error message displayed user newly created user api resulthandling logic may interpret response based content two key falling back main error key make sure wasnt error query syntax connection application likewise query resolvers may return none instead requested object client developer may interpret signal api display requested item doesnt exist message user place requested resource allows return multiple error back client

backend spelling error frontend error response handling might undetected automated testing end production impact development frontend devs dont look backend business logic code find type error possibly returned operation dont define additional result type either however query body verbose due handling union type see example resolver verbosity resolvers return lengthy result one two field

something well frequently deployment situation require consider example following scenario pipeline model face detector run edge device powerful face verification model run powerful remote server idea edge device initial detection face detected pas data remote server cant andor dont want run entire pipeline one machine pipeline requires multiple docker container isolation cant embed every language ksjava like python case well split thing multiple docker container matlab swift etc come mind thing might deploy separate docker image even image run one machine situation nonlinear scaling pipeline

allow capi introduce new manifest property could leveraged user manifest without requiring code change cli biggest risk refactor capi could make change manifest specification would break user push experience cli release new version mitigation accept risk described reason designed cli new manifest parser preserve unrecognized yaml property inmemory representation yaml sent along api end mean capi free make additive change manifest specification user leverage without needing cli change capi make breaking change manifest specification impact cli however discussed capi team unlikely anytime
