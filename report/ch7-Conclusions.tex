    \section{Summary of Findings}
        Summary of key findings.
    \section{Sustainability Practices}
        It appears that capturing AK is essential to avoid knowledge loss, ensure consistent and informed decision-making, and facilitate maintenance and evolution of software systems.
        Key benefits include better impact analysis, understanding design rationale, and sharing knowledge across stakeholders and geographically distributed teams.
        Final points on ADRs before closing
            ADRs is a straightforward and easy way to transform the AK aquired from architecting from implicit to explicit.
            ADRs provide the "why" not the "what" and "how"
            Talk about sustainability and why some other systems in contrast to ADRs are not sustainable.
