\chapter{ADR Dataset Analysis}
    \section{Analysis Methods}
        Innovative analysis methods including machine learning.
    \section{Results and answers to questions}
        Comparative analysis of ADR use with project metrics.
        \subsection{Answer to Q1...}
        - see if trends from previous study have continued --> Revisit prev repos and see if they continued the use of adrs ---> update graphs from prev research
        - A machine learning approach? --> embeddings + clustering + use gpt to extract some stuff depending on questions + sentiment analysis? 
        -  ADR in comparison to repo code complexity code size, stars, size of project, contributors, how active it is (last repo commit)
        - How often do projects make architectural decisions --> interval between file creation --> see correlation with size of the project in terms of lines of code
        - What topic (tags) repos that use adrs are related to (eg machine learning, developer tooling etc) 
        - how many adrs exist in separate documentation repositories and how many are stored alongside code
        - construct dependency graph from ADRs in the same project that have links to other past ADRs. --> see dependencies between decisions --> visualize on gephi and maybe see keywords and present a case study
        - how many repos are follwoing naming conventions, structure conventions etc    
        - how many adrs came from adr-tools github cli tool
