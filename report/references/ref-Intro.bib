abstract = {Throughout the software design process, developers must make decisions and reify them in code. The decisions made during software architecting are particularly significant in that they have system-wide implications, especially on the quality attributes. However, architects often fail to adequately document their decisions because they don&#x27;t appreciate the benefits, don&#x27;t know how to document decisions, or don&#x27;t recognize that they&#x27;re making decisions. This lack of thorough documentation. This paper provides information about a decision&#x27;s rationale and consequences, architecture patterns can help architects better understand and more easily record their decisions.},

  abstract  = "Recent research suggests that architectural knowledge, such as
               design decisions, is important and should be recorded alongside
               the architecture description. Different approaches have emerged
               to support such architectural knowledge (AK) management
               activities. However, there are different notions of and emphasis
               on what and how architectural activities should be supported.
               This is reflected in the design and implementation of existing
               AK tools. To understand the current status of software
               architecture knowledge engineering and future research trends,
               this paper compares five architectural knowledge management
               tools and the support they provide in the architecture
               life-cycle. The comparison is based on an evaluation framework
               defined by a set of 10 criteria. The results of the comparison
               provide insights into the current focus of architectural
               knowledge management support, their advantages, deficiencies,
               and conformance to the current architectural description
               standard. Based on the outcome of this comparison a research
               agenda is proposed for future work on AK tools.",

  abstract  = "The importance of architectural knowledge (AK) management for
               software development has been highlighted over the past ten
               years, where a significant amount of research has been done.
               Since the first systems using design rationale in the seventies
               and eighties to the more modern approaches using AK for
               designing software architectures, a variety of models,
               approaches, and research tools have leveraged the interests of
               researchers and practitioners in AK management (AKM). Capturing,
               sharing, and using AK has many benefits for software designers
               and maintainers, but the cost to capture this relevant knowledge
               hampers a widespread use by software companies. However, as the
               improvements made over the last decade didn't boost a wider
               adoption of AKM approaches, there is a need to identify the
               successes and shortcomings of current AK approaches and know
               what industry needs from AK. Therefore, as researchers and
               promoters of many of the AK research tools in the early stages
               where AK became relevant for the software architecture
               community, and based on our experience and observations, we
               provide in this research an informal retrospective analysis of
               what has been done and the challenges and trends for a future
               research agenda to promote AK use in modern software development
               practices.",
