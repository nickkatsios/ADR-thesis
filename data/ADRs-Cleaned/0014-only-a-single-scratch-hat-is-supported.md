single scratch hat supported scratch run many hat time could implemented arduino cooperative multithreading however would non trivial get right ftduino library built multithreading mind hasnt arduino standard library also program space limited complex program already take memory adding user mode scheduler everything needed cooperative multithreading likely exhaust available memory support single scratch hat multithreading supported consequence multithreading becomes impossible scratch program converted arduino
