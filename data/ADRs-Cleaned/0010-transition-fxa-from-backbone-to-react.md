support popularity backing stability factor pro con continue backbone description dont introduce new framework keep backbone mustache pro tech debt large refactoring effort would necessary right con backbone popularity continues wane likely presented challenge future around support documentation feature developer knowledge experience framework wed giving hard pas benefit would gain another

subsequent comparison description move away backbonemustache content server favor another pro futureproof stack foreseeable future modern library framework significant backing resource placed work angular google react facebook continuing gain community feature support benefit modern architectural approach feature technology offer increase chance new engineer team well open source contributor familiar stack refactoring test assessed clarity fresh pair eye point superfluous test lack neutral modern library framework react angular vuejs offer flavor virtual dom rerenders dom manipulation offer performance boost optimization box backbone offer varying degree would expect see performance boost may case granular dom update would faster without virtual dom con gain tech debt regarding large refactor effort may ongoing time lot work put fxa moving away backbone wont simple task lot infrastructure must ensure support respect integrity transition backbone wont say backbone mustache closely resemble common mvc pattern backbone model tied collection represent backbone view act mustache template act layer angular vue appear follow pattern closely described mvvm react broadly seen mvc react architecture typically follows flux design pattern carefully translate piece backbone model controller state helper function typescript interface applicable whatever new library framework choose require learning curve least part team may slow ability make frontend change first since timeline full transition unknown team member learn become familiar backbone library framework transition move clientside react description clientside react pro react backed wellknown company facebook lot dedicated resource working library popular lot community support ample documentation fxapaymentsserver already react begin thinking reusing component across fxa monorepo react promotes simplicity clarity predictability know data exists top flow child component know data prop type checking component take data subject lifecycle method execute predictable manner every time backbone hand creates json object exposed mustache file dont always know data type backbone also oftentimes influence view via update model multiple model andor controller clear view child rerendered dom element updated react fast bundle state update together figure fewest operation get away giving optimization win box react promotes declarative programming imperative backbone interact dom directly via jquery telling browser exactly imperative react describe component let react browser figure implement declarative much tedious developer allows react handle state change optimally react promotes idea composition inheritance backbone extend view reusability cause difficulty seeing realizing event method data inheriting banana monkey jungle problem overwriting intention component react clear data deliberately passed around react offer many integration react already audited security team con react change fairly often definition knowing react continue grow new concept best practice like react hook deprecated lifecycle method created recommended previous issue licensing around react facebook switched several opensource project including react bsdpatents license mit license community pressure facebook held dominance social medium realm year cannot assume always leader industry understand may wane popularity future however risk around potential decreasing popularity mitigated airbnb uber pinterest twitter reddit netflix major company also react move isomorphic react description serverside rendering ssr technique rendering clientside single page app spa server sending fully rendered page client one part isomorphic universal react application term synonymously clientside react app typically operates browser request page server sends mostly empty html script tag browser downloads page request script react take fetch required data react receives process data display content ssr react app typically operates browser request page server load react memory fetch required data render react app sends html browser browser downloads page display content client react take pro process burden clientside improved first meaningful paint clientonly react give perceived performance boost offer much better seo possibility one primary benefit ssr offer yet applicable fxa page hidden search engine security reason con requires duplicate redux store manually keeping sync state server client framework like nextjs add another layer complexity sharper learning curve tech stack may give performance boost slow device since server work doesnt actually solve heavy initial network request problem brief period initial render react rehydrating user quickly interacts something may nothing move angular description angularjs pro angular backed wellknown company google lot dedicated resource working framework popular lot community support good documentation provides feature likely would fxa without another package dependency certain thing may work automagically con angular steep learning curve since angular fullon framework result heavier bundle result slower application compared react vue provides many feature likely wouldnt fxa angular opinionated expects thing done specific way could make easier developer already familiar angular ramp project could set limitation want architect application significant change historically introduced framework move vuejs pro vue proudly community developer support enthusiasm opensource attitude around making something developer aligns mozilla mission vue flexible allows app structure seen fit support many different html templating language likely smallest learning curve neutral allows mutable state con vue newest library bunch much smaller community large company backing may battletested result much documentation support run specific issue consideration web component web component also considered however library instead set web platform apis allow create new custom reusable encapsulated html tag web page web apps offer strong encapsulation framework library work html dont meet fxa see detailed description example web component polymer project allows functional template like react without virtual dom could worth keeping eye technology matures link create new react app
