contract interface guide structure code allow extendability ensure functionality exchanged without interfering adjacent package within package hierarchy approved approach language feature type hierarchy interface trait contract abstract class good way structure allow replacement ensuring certain behavior interface multiple implementation exist unknown time package introduced example know kind storage within portalbase kind storage supply basic logic commonly interface provide trait others implement easier contract similar interface advantage contain logic beforehand enables add additional code later reduced level change nonbreaking without removing replacing contract best without dependency given constructor force implementation follow pattern regardless whether consequence pro others build logic replace existing one easily con add complexity designing functionality made whether interface contract best suited
