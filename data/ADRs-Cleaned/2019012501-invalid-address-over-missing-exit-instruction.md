invalid address missing exit instruction want program always terminate explicit exit system call instead automatically exit execution reach last program instruction better consistency transparency current version processor unbounded address value prevents recognizing program miss exit instruction theoretically able increment address indefinitely contrast case processor reading directly memory definition limited size program tried read address outside memory signal exit instruction missing let program throw invalid address exception given address cannot found program happen jump instruction try jump invalid address execution reach end program exit instruction provided point next address naturally valid proposed consequence wont possible processor tell given program specifically missing exit instruction would look exactly like invalid jump instruction accept situation assumption program wont usually written directly hexadecimal compiler least assembler designed signal absence required exit instruction
