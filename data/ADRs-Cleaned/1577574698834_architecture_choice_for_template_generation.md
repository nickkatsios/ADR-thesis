architecture choice template generation added utc poc assumes generation table content based content presented page data fetched somewhere presented view way data model wont simple data structure multileveled list might also contain behavior make easier prepare rendering going simple crud application even model contain much behavior port adapter architecture style consequence positive high testability unit integration high configurability clear separation concern domain application enough flexibility building block ddd case necessary negative port adapter usually domain model rich behavior risk overcomplication even simple application like poc standard crud even wont much behavior model dont consider good choice since wont data mapped view model one one also risking decrease possibility unit testing pipe filter great functional programming language like javascript however dont feel comfortable modeling style yet hence could make development longer much complicated reason
