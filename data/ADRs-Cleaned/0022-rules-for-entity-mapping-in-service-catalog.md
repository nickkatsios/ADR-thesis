rule entity mapping service catalog proposed deciders mimotej samokopecky tumido problem statement backstage offer multiple entity type represent entity relation service catalog set rule present operate first provide guidance entity mapped backstage resource driver easy clear guideline distinction resource type support various caveat like odh meta operator cluster serviceresource outcome backstage provides numerous resource type strictly defined relation mermaid erdiagram domain system contains system component contains component component hassubcomponent component component dependson component resource requires component api provides component api consumes resource component dependson resource resource dependson location template group user hasmember group group hasmember relation generated resource manifest extensive documentation supported recognized relation available upstream additionally group user resource resource type resource except group user location required owner specified kind domain entity represents toplevel nonroot entity within cloud think sig type entity whole collection application group service meant work together together example sre domain contains monitoring application cicd etc service catalog etc data science domain contains odh kubeflow data cataloging solution analytics tool thoth station domain thoth related system including repository storage like pulp everything supporting thoth domain owns multiple system kind system system mean collection application component build singular service system meant interaction point user application example service catalog system represents backstage whole odh system represents odh collection component argocd system prow system contains prow component like deck crier horologium etc system resource belongs one domain system resource owns component resource multiple instance service system either different maturity level environment stagingproduction intended different audience odh smaug odh climate system component resource duplicated kind component individual service runtime component usually describes individual kubernetes deployment component kind feature rich entity backstage allows track cicd kubernetes deployment grafana dashboard etc mean component kind individual piece code base home grown external packaged either library dependency oci container example argocd repository server component deck component prow special case complicated architecture multiple entity domain system deployment component resource describe systemlike resource obvious example application belong open data hub open data hub described system resource data science domain due lack intermediate resource type backstage application within open data hub like superset jupyterhub

service backendlike application api provider bot website provide frontend web interface library provides library sort code base dependency template repository service template kind api component backend service may expose api intended consumed others exposed api provide definition either statically dynamically backstage requires specify specdefinition spectype field definition reflect selected type additionally specdefinition directly describe api verbatim reference remote service provided dynamic api definition supported substitution modifier kind resource resource type represents type dependency component object bucket cluster workload hosted etc external dependency service relies entity type describes concrete resource specific database cluster named bucket external saaspaas operate first control kind user represents individual user kind group represents group user team composable unit organization people structure group represent individual service owner contact point kind template backstage interactive form since configuration declarative dont plan entity kind location backstage provides entity type allow extend catalog location since catalog colocated single place dont plan entity reference external location please refrain creating new location instead extend one available service catalog manifest folder root additional note name title description entity required feature metadataname definition additionally advised provide additional detail via metadatatitle display name metadatadescription human readable description entity annotation individual entity type support various annotation allow user enable certain plugins feature understand supported annotation user refer service catalog documentation upstream documentation annotation tag entity type support tagging arbitrary value allowed better restrict value easy filtering search please considered tag dont overly specific unique tag applied single resource helpful link additionally display
