determine new authentication system open apparel registry application currently firebase user authentication new user sign form react client creates record user firebase firebase turn generates user unique source identifier uid legacy oar api connects uploaded facility data legacy api also collates uid api key via keyschema keycontroller apparent aim enabling user create userspecific api key communicating api directly variety reason weve decided replace firebase auth new authentication system previously decided replace legacy api written nodejs restify mongodb new api written python django rest framework postgis change would compel rewrite apis authentication keygenerating mechanism entirely even going keep firebase however since neither civic apps operation much experience firebase production system weve decided replace rather adapt adr explains choice two authentication replace firebase djangorestauth auth ultimately recommends djangorestauth django rest framework django rest auth complement django rest framework djangorestauth add standardized set url endpoint operation simplify single page apps djangos user model djangorestauths documentation enumerates following feature user registration activation loginlogout retrieveupdate django user model password change password reset via email social medium authentication civic apps previously djangorestauth pwd stormdrain marking pwd stormwater connect also known garp similar stack react single page application talking django rest framework api azavea development team also djangorestauth project similar stack temperate project instance djangorestauth angular spa pro familiarity since weve djangorestauth familiar library garp implement registration account activation password reset feature ideally would mean wont spend much time poring djangorestauth documentation source code order set django user model token authentication djangorestauth make django user model also experience model watershed opentreemap model also enables considering drf token authentication generating api key django user model also enables configure permission class python code rather elsewhere django admin since djangorestauth work top djangos user model enables make django admin available administrative task related user anticipate mutiple different type user django admin site offer way user management via web gui without create one react thirdparty dashboard con email legacy oar api confirmation password reset email handled entirely firebase handling via djangorestauth compel set email backend likely amazon note however likely already configuring application boilerplate djangorestauth garp seemed entail writing lot boilerplate code general seems like djangopython code footprint wasnt large write lot react code related signup login password reset form along associated redux action error handling validation likewise well write django template email different kind email djangorestauth generate incidentally react application currently full suite signup signin password reset user profile form already implemented case would adapt component redux action djangorestauth rather firebase django user model djangorestauth rather auth require application thicker user model store user logins password potentially risky store data since application userbase likely international scope likely gdpr consequence social login djangorestauth social login capability feature weve documentation indicates support twitter facebook auth auth thirdparty identity platform provides user signup signin management along addons like email multifactor authentication two selling point ability abstract away many painful part dealing user management vast array integration enable work single page apps mobile apps apis even machinetomachine application like command line tool civic apps previously auth small clientonly react application raster foundry extensive experience auth pro reduced boilerplate auth provides nearly dropin signup signin password reset auth site tutorial react project general idea react app would include authservice class couple required route clicking button sign login would move user auth sign via user interface mean react apps auth implement form component redux apparatus handling signin auth also provides mechanism whereby redirect would internal url say httpexamplecom httpauthexamplecom social login along usernamepassword combination auth box support logging via google extended support numerous identity provider including github weibo configuring new identity provider typically entail setting new application provider site appears work automatically afterwards thin django user model since auth presumably would store data related user logins profile permission resulting django user model could thin essentially would gather whatever auth provides together api key token foreign key group also roughly legacy apis keyschema designed pricing general auth seems would free monthly active user number price start grow linearly tried auth pricing wizard appeared maus cost per month per month rate seem completely reasonable certain auth would save lot developer time con integration django rest framework api along guide auth react auth django rest framework auth documentation site also guide integrating auth application designed api single page app roughly similar wed want build guide fairly straightforward follow also seems indiciate there quite bit complexity manage general idea user signed react app would get jwt would send api api turn would decode token determine whether user correct set permission whatever request differential permission set configuring set role auth web api endpoint get decorator indicate permission require permission class auth dashboard auth handle differential access user type via authorization extension enables auth dashboard create different role permission user default stored auths webtask storage since provides storage there numerical limit combination user role wed set bucket store permission documentation note roughly equivalent group user user member group group user user member group addition user management would take place auth dashboard mean people user management would given auth login api key generation although seems like authbased system may also allow drfs token authentication api key generation workflow weve set raster foundry prediction api application api token main raster foundry application created band unfamiliarity firebase civic apps comparatively unfamiliar auth production civic apps auth small backendless react application case small set user known advance mean signup mechanism across azavea raster foundry seems auth extensively prediction api application drf api react spa auth roughly similar wed antipate creating application also seems small known set user raster foundry main application also auth team encountered friction early trying adapt change auth made api djangorestauth familiar enough djangorestauth work setting involve typing rather thinking problem fact react already includes custom signup login etc form component suggests itll bit cumbersome would starting scratch building clientonly react application talked number third party service think itd make sense integrate auth however since django backend seems leverage capability django includes user management django admin email like interested trying auth smaller project committing larger one consequence result choosing djangorestauth authentication well plan include djangorestauth project register proper url possibly also adjust initial migration create new user model well also adjust react application form work new auth system decide retain existing firebase user data well also determine migrate alternatively could also plan require user sign new account new api
