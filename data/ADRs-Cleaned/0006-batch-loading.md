batch loading proposed like many database system mongodb support batch update data significantly faster individual update case loading data must many update particular document search deserialize document time load operation may suffer polynomial slowdown update take progressively longer document grows size loading data perform update given document time particular minimize number time deserialize given cluster consequence increase overall complexity system allows loading data timely fashion especially large cluster best performance input data sorted oclc control number ocn loading system may require additional complexity management data file loaded system particular best performance holding multiple institution sorted together ocn loaded time system still handle unsorted data potential significantly slower likely important initial load full reload incremental update data sorted way frequent write operation adding multiple subdocuments given document example adding multiple holding given ocn cluster ensure update happen performant way mongodb call mongodb push operation subdocuments directly also allows ensure write operation completes successfully see adr
