adr commit message format proposed author damir murat damirmuratgit gmailcom reviewer none commit message without structure look convenient developer think message much unfortunately freedom lack thinking impose additional burden longterm project maintenance quite often find incomprehensible commit message communicate anything useful hopefully imposing lightweight rule guidance help developer create commit message helpful colleague addition unstructured commit message much opportunity introduce tool top commit history example would like employ automated changelog generator based extracting semantical meaning commits work commit message lack structure without commit message structure dump commit log changelog make changelog helpful looking history commits first place architectural system klokwrkproject customized conventional commits format writing commit message conventional commits format nice short defines simple structure easy learn follow basic structure customized conventional commits format typeoptional scope description optional metadata customization defines additional message type extension type defined angular team allows adding additional metadata message title useful appropriate see detail section info requires format compliance message significant commits see detail section info detail detail given mainly set strong recommendation strongly recommended rule enforced tooling rule case tooling implemented git commit hook every contributor install git hook provided repository done following command executed project root git config corehookspath supportgithooks might case implemented rule appropriate updated removed temporarily ignored scenario hook skipped git noverify describing detail following term described commit message title refers first line commit message commit message description refers part title describing commit humanreadable message conventional commits specification part called description general guidance rule commit message strongly recommended avoid trivial commit message title description strongly recommended imperative mood title description add instead adding added update instead updating updated etc spelling command rule message title description must start uppercase letter main reason desire better readability want easily spot beginning message description title argument lowercase like message title sentence true prefer better readability comply vague constraint rule message title description end common punctuation character strongly recommended message title description comprised multiple sentence rule message title longer character message body space description needed actually common convention character message title look like main reason github truncates anything char message title tight constraint seems unreasonable today apparent shortcoming tool shouldnt restrict even tool github strongly recommended commit message title description describe sometimes instead describing message body appropriate space needed message body may contain clearly separated least blank line recommended commit message title provide optional scope conventional commit specification applicable commit refers multiple scope scope separated character commit refers work influence whole project scope project left scope single word lowercase strongly recommended message body must separated message title single blank line message body contain additional blank line recommended message body line longer character strongly recommended include relevant reference issue pull request metadata section message title example featsomemodule adding new feature fix related resolve include relevant featurebug ticket link message footer according conventional commits guideline footer separated body single blank line guidance rule normal commits main development branch rule commits main development branch must message title customized conventional commit format guidance rule merge commits main development branch semilinear commit history merge commits primary carrier completed work unit interesting creating changelog merging merge commits must rebased main development branch merging must executed nofastforward noff rule merge commits must merge metadata present end title way merge commits easily distinguished github changelog merge commit metadata carry additional information related issue reference like following example featklokwrktoolgradlesourcerepack adding new feature fix related resolve reference issue reference pull request additional metadata controlled enforced git hook guidance rule normal commits feature branch normal commits dont follow custom conventional commits format message title strongly recommended normal commits conventional commits format contained change significant enough placed changelog useful changelog entry contained normal commits feature branch two different thing depending situation merge commit type notype merge commit ignored creating changelog merge branch fastforward merge commit present preferably notype merge commits still useful clear separation related work type conventional commits format common angular feat feature new feature fix bug fix doc documentation change style change affect meaning code whitespace formatting missing semicolon etc test adding missing test correcting existing test build change affect build system external dependency change configuration file script refactor code change neither fix bug add feature perf code change improves performance chore routine task custom enhance enhancement improvement existing feature deps dependency update instead build commit update dependency two main scenario upgrading dependency simple version bump involved upgrade requiring resolving various issue like compilation error api upgrade etc simple version bump contained single individual commit description message starting word bump example deps bump micronaut version complicated upgrade organized feature branch nonconventional commit resolve single step process finished feature branch merged main development branch description starting word upgrade example deps upgrade spring boot version task meaning chore prefer task article instead doc change related article misc anything fit previous category notype merge commits situation contained plain commits carry relevant type merge commit doesnt add anything useful ignored changelog typical example updating number dependency commits feature branch situation feature branch commit contain update single dependency communicate update commit message conventional commit format update branch tested merge main branch however merge ignored changelog communicate anything new consequence positive facility thinking commit message provide useful changelog information facility thinking organizing feature branch many conventional commits single branch maybe separate two applied consistently provides basis automating changelog creation neutral adopting may hard come appropriate message title description negative additional expectation responsibility developer considered prescribing commit message format reference
