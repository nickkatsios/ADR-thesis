adr tenant isolation superseded adr soft multitenancy two main isolation model kubernetes namespaces within single cluster running multiple cluster service team currently separate aws account service team separate aws account separate environment staging production etc many service team microservice architecture service team unique network isolation requirement may hard implement shared environment ensure smooth transition migration would preferable cluster deployed service team vpcs ensure separation billing would preferable deploy cluster service team aws account ensure strong networkcompute isolation service team would preferable deploy separate cluster separate environment manage multiple kubernetes cluster one per environment per tenant provide strong networkcompute isolation service team clear separation billing ability deploy target vpcs make piecemeal microservice migration practical consequence management multiple cluster across multiple account may complex managing single big one lack direct control target accountenvironment may introduce complexity
