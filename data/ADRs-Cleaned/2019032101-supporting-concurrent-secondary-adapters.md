supporting concurrent secondary adapter define secondary port purpose allow different kind adapter hook port however simplest case implementation application allow single adapter attached port time example java public interface notifier public void notifymessage message java public class logger implement notifier override public void notifymessage message loggerlogmessagegetmessage java public class provider public void register containerbindnotifier logger single type adapter attached specific port time thats obvious application service port expect receive single object instance port attach multiple adapter port time example want multiple notifiers send notification abstract message produced example sending email addition logging message standard solution case message bus multiple handler registered handle certain type message creating bus adapter would work proxy route message registered handler java public class busnotifier implement notifier public void notifymessage message bussendmessage would still attaching single secondary adapter time supporting multiple one like logger email notifier etc course application structure reused change whatsoever moment decide single secondary adapter could replace bus adapter single adapter proposed consequence multiple secondary adapter indirectly attached port time without hindering application structure
