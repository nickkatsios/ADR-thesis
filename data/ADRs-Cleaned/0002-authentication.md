authentication progress couple client project simple authentication system one project already flask postgres another design phase short term want minimal functional authentication system implemented soon possible long term hope implementation would reused many time easily customized dropin library flask project create minimal reference authentication implementation flask postgres include unit test hopefully strive high code coverage database migration organize database logic simplified cqrsinspired style code structure appmodelspy contain sql model appservicespy contain command modify database state appqueriespy contain query database delay feature arent current project requirement kind feature may addressed future version initially implement reference flask extension possibly add pypi public repository create react reference implementation password reset email account verification permission multi factor authentication oauth expiring token revokingblacklisting token prevent reuse old password consequence project template run risk creating lot little ball mud antipattern
