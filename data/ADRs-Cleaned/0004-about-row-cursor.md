aboutrowcursor proposed rawrow frame library expose row data stored frame moment rawrow implemented export type rawrow approach expose implementation detail frame row oriented storage would want swap implementation row oriented column oriented storage may change implementation detail break code people library hide implemntation detail roworiented storage columnoriented storage main difference two storage cost accessing row column roworiented columnoriented get row get column simplified version really depends implementation well hybrid solution like return cursor instead raw data get data lazily moment data loaded memory distinction critical soon would want switch implementation proxy read data remote server important rename minimal improvement make rename rawrow rowcursor shift away mentality roworiented storage get value table would two cursor like coordinate latitude longitude columncursorrowcursor right getvaluerowcursor columncursor rowcursorcolumncursor hide implementation next step would hide implementation wrap row object hide shape data flow hide implementation opaque type maybe something similar possible interface premature optimisation moment possible write rowcursorcolumncursorindex columncursorrowcursor assumption array access faster function call inside still array access may happen premature optimisation expose lot implementation detail possible middleground would macro developer would write columncursorrowcursor generated contains rowcursorcolumncursorindex case would change implmentation well change implementation macro user library doesnt worry implemntation detail took first step rename think step future consequence
