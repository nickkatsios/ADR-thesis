multiple usage processor domain virtual machine supporting concerned running program program run business rule processor domain service encapsulating rule application level think several feature support domain classic virtual machine running entire program perhaps loaded file termination repl instruction loaded one time interactive prompt executed printing kind output time debug still entire program time want support debugging feature like running stepbystep course could many others definition processor domain support case keep processor domain service three different kind execution want support really differ data handled memory domain doesnt concern contained memory doesnt even mention memory since detail interpreter might well interpreter dont memory classic virtual machine program entire program executed start end repl situation time new instruction inserted prompt added program fed processor necessary might defined procedure want call future state memory saved different execution doesnt concern domain make program start latest instruction add new unconditional jump instruction beginning actually mean dont run entire program isnt necessary since memory preserved last inserted instruction debug situation interpreter implementation avoid returning control back processor requested still doesnt concern processor implementation domain proposed consequence processor definition domain stay abstract enough mentioning real business reuse different application situation
