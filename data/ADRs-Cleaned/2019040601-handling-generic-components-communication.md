handling generic component communication easiest technical solution let different layer communicate example adapter application direct method call like injecting presenter interactor let interactor call method presenter object however generic case communication since doesnt support situation concurrent component component running different process address space messaging think multiple adapter connecting port time easiest case secondary adapter notification secondary port sending notification might want attach several different adapter like logging adapter email adapter etc port time message available adapter notify recipient secondary port interface construct programming language like class interface demanding object injected one adapter ever available time interactor course could provide smart adapter multiplex call different adapter behind scene want clean generic solution situation happen primary port well even though case think adapter running different process thread secondary port case could happen also component sharing thread primary adapter run actual execution thread want different device able primary port time like posting new order web interface web api time adapter application run process address space still direct method call course handling concurrency issue understand generic communication structure remember port example presenter necessarily programming construct like class interface construct concept representing set message sent within certain example message related presenting output common case message implemented public method class interface construct nothing prevents implement message object handled message bus port set message adapter set message handler registered respond message handler might well method old presenter object instead directly called interactor theyre called message bus time conceptually thing would allow reuse component different deploy situation adding intermediate bus also fact message may handler registered doesnt really represent different situation also direct call couldnt sure actual presentation performed calling method interface concrete class injected could null object could think direct procedure call like special case generic messaging communication case component running address space simplify design direct call adapter accessing port concurrently either wont handle communication concurrently furthermore one presenter interactor interactor calling asynchronously one presenter view interactor might well directly return response controller create view mapping response happens regular web application microservices general messaging communication protocol lead naturally microservices deployment strategy message bus called api gateway microservices parlance represents entire application api seen client thus api gateway actually part application layer simplified implementation api gateway allows interactors located inside gateway component interactor would gateway get request primary port communicate secondary adapter secondary port port set message implemented api gateway strategy make sense interactor doesnt deployed service usually case since interactors called interactors gateway however case interactor horizontally scaled meaning replicated bear bigger load case course want deploy interactor service api gateway would communicate internal protocol instead direct method call even though conceptually there difference api gateway thus surface enveloping application component allowing communicate external world primary port would connected primary adapter secondary port would connected secondary adapter proposed consequence generic design communication component happens via message bus possible simplify design specific area right condition met
