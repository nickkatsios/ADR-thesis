regex user input implemented goal filter planned autolink subgoals feature rely data entered manually user two obvious way implement allow user type substring search goal containing substring allow user type regular expression search goal matching expression second solution seems much powerful also much dangerous uncontrolled evaluation userdefined regex may cause unexpected crash data loss potentially high cpu load seem undesirable allow entering userdefined regular expression sieben substringbased logic must allowed consequence expect following consequence would possible implement complex autolinking logic filtering autolinking work fast fewer bug logic comparing regex
