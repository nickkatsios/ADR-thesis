stop register processor communication processor interpreter must way processor pas interpreter instruction execute interpreter supposed able update instruction pointer tell processor execution stop exit currently intermediate component register partially like real processor work containing information exit however communication processor interpreter straightforward much simpler solution would classical call argument call return value register could mediator sense processor interpreter would unaware register implement mechanism automatically notify involved party change made seems overkill interpreter keep taking instruction processor time return data structure tell exit triggered case whats exit consequence processor doesnt define interface register interpreter dont implement anymore communication simplified
