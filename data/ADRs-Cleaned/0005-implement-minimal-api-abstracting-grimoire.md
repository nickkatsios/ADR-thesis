implement minimal api abstracting grimoire grimoire great single source truth due well designed datamodel apis grimoire expose following drawback however clojure specific language reimplement storage abstraction tedious work bugprone slightly unwieldy case seems common tooling author want build top grimoire data give information artifact namespaces defs version etc artifact could something like bidi order make grimoire data easy possible wide variety language implement minimal cache api top api following property filebased single file contain different bundle grimoire data file encoded transit reduce cost duplicate string similar file regenerated time initial implementation cache fund cljdoccache fccb spec written cljdocspec cache follows basic form clojure cacheid cachecontents cache storage could also implemented storage implementation grimoire benefit would grimoire operation supported given want expose api small subset grimoire multiple language utility immediately apparent consequence cache map may extended future especially timestamp generated could useful validate bundle regenerated certain point time since cachemap generation structure may change course time also become primary api versioning also considered could simple additional field cacheformat get incremented time cache format change
