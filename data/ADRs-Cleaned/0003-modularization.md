modularization riptide started monolithic project worked good enough long feature minimal dependency growing feature set several issue came single artifact became bloated hard tell core functionality apart additional optional feature picking feature carte unnecesarily hard since usually involved carefully includeexclude optional dependency order counter aspect riptide fundamentally build idea module manifest two aspect module subdirectory hosting maven submodule containing separate package dedicated readme core several api extension point spis encourage modularization plugin interface extend processing pipeline request response route interface build compose reuse response handling function navigator interface build custom routing algorithm attribute interface provide public interaction point plugins usually criterion extract something separate module include limited isolate rarely dependency ideally single module group functionality logically single responsibility principle different maturity level therefore higher probabilty change openclosed principle consequence multiple module unique distinct purpose allows user pick module provide something really also keep list dependency small manageable another sideeffect module exposing spis even initually module open possibility user provide extension one aspect keep mind though interaction module slightly harder implement since always consider fact module
