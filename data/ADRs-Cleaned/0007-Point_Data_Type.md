point datatype proposed paul dub discussed alex black multiple way one represent point existing data type however way classified workaround bounding box zero width height list double ndarray dont communicate intent content well communicating intent important building maintainable system point data type suggested create point datatype explicitly meant point based data point datatype represent point number dimension limited dimensional point order make conversion bounding box point easier point like bounding box also provide optional label probability field access specific dimension point direct getdimension method provided anticipate dimensional point going often typical based notation also allowed trough method internally call get get get respectively value point usually fall relative measure especially useful data type like image however required within range meaning absolute value also allowed interpreting meaning point value user point data type going implemented interface implementation split however single implementation take ndimensional point ever become problem able provide specialized implementation without breaking existing code consequence advantage point semantically represented point datatype disadvantage add another datatype instead exists already discussion discussed different way implementing point data type discussed included single implementation without specific interface interface multiple implementation ultimately chosen single implementation interface definition benefit approach provide fixed interface stay intact even additional implementation added dont risk unmaintained seldom unused point type specific implementation often
