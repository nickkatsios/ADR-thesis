adr solo machine sign byte changelog initial draft applied solomachine implementation ibcgo constructed sign byte datatype described type data signed design arose misunderstanding security implication noted proto definition provide uniqueness necessity ensuring two signature different data type never missed uniqueness provided proto definition usage proto definition path provided core ibc unique already encoded signature data thus two different path data value encode differently provides signature uniqueness furthermore current construction support proposed change spec repo support generic verification function order verify new path new datatype must added path remove datatype change datatype signbytes signatureanddata path new path field byte remove data proto definition except headerdata data definition created previously datatype proto version solo machine proto definition bumped remove extra layer complexity signature construction allows support generic verification consequence positive simplification solo machine signature construction support generic verification negative break existing signature construction nonbackwards compatible way solo machine must update handle new format migration required solo machine client consensus state neutral notable consequence reference
