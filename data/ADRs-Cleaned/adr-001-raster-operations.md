second raster reading catalog checking geotrellis doc going attempt include endpoint three operation implementing api issue local variety focal standard deviation zonal histogram geotrellis ops dont map precisely onto catalogued theyre documented geotrellis capability along endpoint ops going try writing two additional endpoint endpoint generate png tile color ramp documented endpoint write data geotiff seems available via geotiffwriter module five api endpoint going implement path service localvariety return local variety result focalstandarddeviation return focal standard deviation result zonalhistogram return zonal histogram result pngtile return png tile fit shape geotiff return geotiff drawn shape along raster data accept geojson posted client consequence one upcoming issue research project choose raster project ill keep mind whether data set may interesting local variety focal standard deviation zonal histogram ops
