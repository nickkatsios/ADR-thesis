title implement app system inside platform area core tag app cloud different extension mechanism besides well known plugins work cloud onprem environment way thats envisioned app system currently publicly available plugin able quickly develop app system gather feedback iterate idea without bound strict release workflow shopware platform reason started working app system plugin first place app system matured time integrate app system back platform following benefit sends signal partner potential app manufacturer app system stable partner app manufacturer rely shopware release cycle according upgrade process user dont install extra plugin order apps app system concept app system designed run multi tenant saas system well premise system limitation new extension point compared plugin system app consists manifest file containing meta data app example extension point app etc optionally storefront customizations template snippet theme configuration app system limitation php code execution php code execution cannot allowed multi tenant system due security reason cannot trust third party code cannot run third party code shopware server app system third party backend code run third party server communicate api shopware server general administration extension extending administration custom like plugins cannot allowed due security reason mainly due fact apps code run system current user hisher permission administration extension plugins app permission app granted reason custom extension point created specifically actionbuttons custom module allow extending administration without running administration application nothing requires constant file access cloud environment possible store individual meaning per tenant file directly local filesystem server possible though store information distant storage like whole different performance characteristic storing file disk possible allow constant file access meaning reading file every request example thats reason metadata associated apps content manifest file template change stored database shop additionally storefront theme file accessed theme compilation directly served cdn constant access source file required app system extension point webhook app register webhooks notified predefined url event happen inside shopware actionbutton app display extra button selected detail listing page inside administration perform custom action selected entity custom module app display inside administration done via iframes embedded administration custom field app register custom field set displayed along custom field inside administration storefront customizations app able customize storefront way plugin includes theme system custom twig template custom regard theme system apps treated way plugins especially regarding theme inheritance apps explicitly set inheritance chain via technicalappname referenced directly part fallback plugins namespace extension point may added new feature app system make sure violate one limitation mentioned additionally taken account possible deploy run feature cloud environment migrate existing app system plugin platform app system part core bundle analogous plugin system moved shopwarecoreframeworkapp namespace migration process try split migration multiple ensure code review made needed care therefore migration split multiple coherent part build necessary change hidden behind feature flag change invisible user migration process completely finished practice feature flag minimized app system currently come administrative usable cli ensuring migrate cli command install activate apps last step migration process make sure change made previously dont visible effect without feature flag release app system starting migration appsystem migrated feature set platform point new development plugin stopped continue inside platform migration completed apps work app system plugin work way app system inside platform mean migration wont introduce breaking change point view app developer plugin developer extended app system migration likely breaking change change internal structure app system change php class name name space entity name etc migration process finished release app system plugin sole purpose update migrate app data old plugin data structure new platform data structure make sure apps previously installed app system plugin continue work app system platform mean shop shopware version prior version release app system part platform app system plugin already app system shop shop already version app system included part platform start right away apps dont plugin shop apps app system plugin update platform version app system included update app system plugin right upgrading platform version already installed apps continue work plugin safely deleted necessary anymore consequence consequence app system considered stable migration process completed mean wont introduce change may break existing apps minor patch version especially includes following change manifest schema strict schema manifest file two benefit manifest file quickly validated developing time inside ides app developer autocompletion feature ides greatly improves developer experience however schema change existing schema made way wont break existing apps new stuff added schema loosened nothing removed made stricter making radical change schema new version schema introduced must ensured apps enough time adapt new schema thats necessary period version schema supported change format outgoing request send multiple request third party app backends registration triggering webhooks triggering actionbuttons loading custom module format request cannot changed breaking way minor patch version mean possible add new parameter outgoing request remove rename existing parameter needed made major version documented properly app developer adapt change change possible break point view app developer documented separate app system section inside changelog upgrade file additionally app system plugin deprecated migration process finished development take place inside platform
