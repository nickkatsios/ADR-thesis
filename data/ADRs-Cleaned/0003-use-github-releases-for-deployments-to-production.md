github release deployment production november existing production deployment process psd involves two branch develop main develop working branch target feature branch github workflow deploys develop staging merge production deployment required develop merged main trigger another github workflow deploy preprod production due hotfixes merged directly main well nonrebase merges merging develop main mismatching commit hash merging hotfixes back develop develop main merge nearly always encounter conflict direction thereby preventing production deployment happening via agreed process situation workaround involves deleting main pushing copy develop main trigger github workflow latest code dangerous since involves deleting main branch well temporarily disabling branch protection process also make difficult deploy anything current state develop branch roll back required psd transition deployment workflow based github release one branch main working branch target feature branch merges main trigger github workflow deploy staging similar manner existing workflow production deployment required new github release created tag based version number creation release trigger github workflow deploy preprod production pro prevents merge conflict develop main merge process allows release created based existing tag represents point main current state allows deployment triggered based older tag roll back con requires creation github release new process compared known process alternative full git flow process considered would involve creating release branch based twobranch develop main layout however would still require release branch merged main well back develop therefore would double amount work per deployment necessarily prevent merge conflict full git flow also difficult implement fully github especially branch protection heavy requirement consequence significant consequence
