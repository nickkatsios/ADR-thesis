transformer architecture approved develop event transformer either backend architecture processor architecture making transformer backends result relatively nesting configuration backend configuration decide develop event transformer processor result complexity code since transformer easily appended backends router logger processor pipeline transformer developed event processor added backends pipeline transformed event purpose either simply logging loggerbackend route event eventroutingbackend consequence developing transformer processor result relatively complex configuration would provide wider range case transformer
