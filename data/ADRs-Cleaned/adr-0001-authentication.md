authenticationuser management raster foundry support following requirement regarding user authentication registration ability support oauth sso authentication beyond simple usernamepassword basic user management necessary resetting password deactivating user grouping user organization object layer tool user etc may limited scope user organization role within organization user able generate client token programmatic access revoked past entire user management workflow handled via web framework django extension user registration usually done adhoc basis utilizing extending thirdparty addons could executed successfully case issue first thirdparty addons needed rely additional integration like saml underdeveloped required either significant extension diving code lack documentation second new application required starting almost scratch inclusion additional service basic functionality instance user registration passwordmanagement required setting email serversservices asynchronous worker send email broker manage asynchronous worker third problem weve experienced past mixing authentication technique provided django session token create unintended difficulty isolating authentication problem another case would thirdparty service streamlines user management registration service mentioned often stormpath auth amazon cognito service benefit disadvantage documentation stormpath auth good documentation slight edge going auth number sdks especially frontend backend frameworkslanguages stormpaths documentation slightly harder navigate auths starter application example made putting together simple application much easier documentation cognito fairly dense difficult determine service terminology documentation unique amazon whereas stormpath auth share common language much literature already exists token authentication user management multitenancy handling multiple tenant raster foundry requirement stormpath auth good documentation handle respective system amazon cognito documentation isnt clear however another would continue manage roleslevels database would still able leverage service managing user password would also able easily control database constraint organization user storing organization role user metadata service seems somewhat risky data service get sync data modeled database third party integration stormpath auth fair amount thirdparty integration almost draw instance google facebook twitter etc auth also number integration service make attractive instance integrates well papertrail forward loginlogout information keep log event pricing little difficult compare pricing amongst service different metric determine price auths plan determined number monthly active user set feature provides free plan support active user basic feature satisfy requirement development possibly even early phase released product feature may influence switch paid plan social login free plan limited two customized email template basic plan start month active user pricing start add however pricing scale based number user correlate revenue may important stormpath pricing based number api call feature free plan feature auth free plan limited api call probably relevant user signing time month next plan month comparable feature paid plan auth api call user closest auth plan price signing time month amazon cognito far cheapest though fraction feature auth stormpath cognito free monthly user additional user reduced pricing user raster foundry thirdparty service auth manage user authentication better documentation sdks third party integration suggest reduce development time provide full set login user registration feature application additionally provides capability write custom javascript code execute authentication process utilizing auth two token type access token signed json web token jwt authenticate request api client application web native etc refresh token longlived revokable user generated token programmatic api

expiration time jwt adjusted based user activity log user soon instance percent user make api call every minute percent make one least every minute would likely want set expiry little longer minute depending want handle token revocation andor forcing login period time likely want application level timeout token cannot reissued indefinitely additionally user decides reset password log completely may want set timestamp database check issue time ensure token issued timestamp refresh token refresh token opaque string get new jwt auth indefinite unless revoked tied client application token allow user set programmatic access application complicate sdkscommand line client somewhat client handle jwt expiration gracefully following diagram auth illustrates usage operate consequence choosing auth consequence first set frontend application auth authentication user signup second library web server validate signature jwt many third make encode user role organization database andor auth lastly come determination appropriate expiration time jwt risk involved adopting auth handle user management largest risk decide auth appropriate solution come plan exporting user support claim provide export user database request yet selfservice way likelihood coming determination like auth significant user low still possibility api call involved migrating another provider like stormpath seem prohibitive
