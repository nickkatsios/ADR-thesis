horizontal migration approved current migration strategy migrating page symfony migration actually migration refactoring includes switching view smarty twig switching listing helperlist grid switching form helperform symfony form applying cqrs layer process take long time result back office structure become heterogeneous page fully symfonybased others full legacybased increasing developer performance overhead addition legacy subsystem must remain place continue maintained cannot removed long legacy page prestashop still year worth work ahead finish let imagine migrating rest back office symfony current strategy take say year mean year still page running legacy architecture still maintain admincontroller dispatcher override etc whole time migration finished year accelerate phasingout legacy subsystem strategy migrate remaining page changed instead migrating refactoring whole page single shot divide migration stage covering different technical layer deliver single stage migration page time identified migration stage controller layer view layer form layer cqrs layer time migrate page migrate part corresponding first stage first stage performed remaining page move second stage perform page left migrate repeat stage complete migration finished call strategy horizontal migration opposition previous strategy referred vertical migration focus finishing whole technical layer across page moving next layer end result full migration symfony path get change first stage migrate controller layer first stage consists migrating controller layer symfony based frameworkbundleadmincontrollers service router actionmethods keeping original behavior within controller includes maintaining smarty template engine well closely related legacy component like helperlist helperform others new namespace bridge created within prestashopbundle contain intermediary code removed migration progress example temporary trait added horizontally migrated syfony controller enabling necessary legacy feature belong fully migrated symfony controller like smarty support trait meant removed feature longer required legacycontrollerbridgeinterface replaces controller present providing method needed module dont belong symfony controller including setmedia addcss addjs addjqueryplugin addjqueryui also provide access public field accessible admincontroller class keep much backward compatibility possible phpself controllername table metatitle helper legacy helper bridge adapt work symfony example helperlistconfigurator configures helperlist helperlistconfiguration resetfiltershelper filtershelper class come legacy handle filter list reset filter helperlistbridge class bridge helper list render list controller smarty layout since smarty twig handle initialization layout feature menu header etc vertically migrated controller handled legacylayoutadmincontroller done kernel event listener called initcontrollerlistener mean horizontally migrated controller longer initialize fake admincontroller getting rid admincontroller requires set high number variable configured required layout stored controllerconfiguration object initialized configurator class charge setting different part page breadcrumbsandtitleconfigurator footerconfigurator headerconfigurator modalconfigurator notificationconfigurator toolbarflagsconfigurator finally controller action return generated html response instance smarty default theme instead twig new theme following stage adr focus detailing first migration stage outline next stage follows second stage smarty removed controller favor twig require adapting existing helper work twig new theme well complete removal legacylayoutcontroller third stage progressively phase helperlists helperforms favor grid symfony form form theme extension feature found vertically migrated controller fourth final stage consist introduction cqrs layer removing logic controller followed removal obsolete component like admincontrollers make sense suppose page left migrate instead creating containing line changed file taking forever complete review verify create four group first modify page controller leaving rest code untouched second modify page template switching twig third introduce symfony form grid fourth add cqrs group cannot started previous group finished compared vertical approach horizontal approach might take slightly longer complete however main advantage longer wait whole migration project complete able remove obsolete subsystem soon stage complete developer benefit single way thing across system obsolete legacy subsystem removed example controller migrated symfony dispatcher admincontroller longer needed removed deprecated developer benefit symfony debug bar everywhere reducing scope migration deliverable event happen lot sooner wait whole project finished following previous hypothetical duration year finish whole migration could get rid admincontroller dispatcher two year instead four would take vertical approach smarty could removed three year instead four reducing perimeter deliverable smaller chunk mean smaller translate easier faster review validation still continue vertical approch page horizontal approach would make tactical sense either simple benefit advantage horizontal migration require extensive refactoring product page
