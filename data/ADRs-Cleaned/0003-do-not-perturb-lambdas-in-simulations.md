perturb lambda simulating family simulation generated based lambda value provided user seemed simulation generated realistic enough thought slightly modifying lambda value every often would create realistic simulation code implemented simply base simulated family given lambda perturb lambda consequence simulated family slightly smaller variance size one want recreate simulated condition think perturb one want simulate realistic condition recover number rate category perturb work better although made sttdev normal distribution around multiplier much smaller got rid negative lambda still worked well dividing like instead
