load read stream transaction proposed reading stream within transaction call loadstream must supported number benefit rather reading stream outside transaction transaction call loadstream run retry risk leaking resource multiple stream may created never get returned caller caller opportunity close stream read entirely inside transaction also closed inside transaction make safe run retries since retries also close stream load actual stream data read outside transaction read fail example stream deleted instead read performed inside transaction failed read would also cause transaction fail could desired example result reading stream want perform writes based read data make sense perform single transaction reading stream inside transaction call loadstream preferred method unless specific reason read must performed later outside transaction reading stream supported inside transaction loaded outside transaction commits abort consequence internal product currently rely able read stream transaction loadstream called must supported unless first ensure internal product rewritten never read stream transaction load
