solution implemented one gcp project implement ddd defines ubiquitous language implement solution facilitates coherent set business function related gcp project belongs single domain solution facilitates coherent set business function function originate multiple domain project always belongs single domain therefore solution implemented multiple project either due fact requires function multiple domain project allow better modularization solution implement solution one project consequence advantage platform project structure facilitate separation concern modularization responsibility functionality easily defined along project boundary disadvantage additional overhead multiple small project created functionality multiple domain required
