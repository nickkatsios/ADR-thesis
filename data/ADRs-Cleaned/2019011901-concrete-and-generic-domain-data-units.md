concrete generic domain data unit weve thinking defining abstract concept dataunit data dataunit share interface data interface contains lot method example comparison arithmetic etc however upon reviewing usage concept domain module evident complex feature werent actually needed addition idea domain defined interface data unit architecture provided implementation introduced annoying problem let architecture control loading program program would contain actual data unit defined architecture leading definition stringloader framework domain program considered string independent specific architecture also architecture specific program loader given string loader translate string program data unit program making domain logic structure system quite complicated well agree whatever special data implementation architecture may come must base concept byte thats program ultimately made thus data unit byte actually runtimeindependent implementation additionally since domain framework module concept data unit laid sequence create bigger chunk data well define data list dataunit feature needed comparison arithmetic etc also concept size simplified become integer runtimeindependent implementation concept address moved program module data module since talk address data unit within chunk data proposed consequence architecture still free defining specific implementation data example word double etc definition wont outside architecture code data module much simple program loader completely independent architecture greatly simplifying design
