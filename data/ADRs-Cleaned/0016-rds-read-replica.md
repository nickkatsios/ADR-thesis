rds read replica response multiple challenge proposed pulled original discussion google doc challenge database access without impacting user currently analyst anyone else want pull fresh data production produce data denormalized form may convenient analysis hit production database directly challenge single source failure problem production database instance would probably take restore database tta hub would actually incident needed took several hour lost significant data due backup age challenge replication stage script create piifree copy production database exists run running copy production database without engineering mean running prod copy locally challenge read replica technically allow analyst access production data without placing load database backing production application query way please however access anything prod tightly controlled requiring coordination multiple people probably case read replica useful time challenge read replica promoted primary within minute far faster restoring backup loses little data however promotion neither transparent connection setting would change instantaneous take bit time reach consistent state would perform engineering work allow swapping application standby instance thered still delay given rather small data size gain relative starting new instance last snapshot would probably small worth pointintime backup however recent incident seems indicate pointintime backup available hand read replica limited protection data corruption incident would act extremely quickly prevent corruption spreading replica replica help main get stuck somehow there data mistake could get nicer version aurora mostly dropin compatible challenge could potentially promote read replica instance run script however thats probably complicating thing could easily terraform script start database latest snapshot run script produce new snapshot phase start database would also safer script would obviate possibility accidentally choosing wrong database verdict possible benefit rds read replica seem like possibly worthwhile response second single source failure challenge whether worth near term clear consequence adding read replica extremely low impact small extra hosting cost engineering effort minimal however make really help would cost engineering effort
