kubernetes cpu resource limit request review following completion ticket pic set appropriate cpu memory request limit issue pic raised unwanted throttling happening prod change causing poor performance following discussion cloud platform bit research hypothesise issue caused nonobvious quirk kubernetes cpu request limit cause heavy throttling cpu limit low relative cpu request key thing note cpu request bearing throttling whatsoever pod allocation node must least much allocated cpu limit provides upper limit much cpu time pod given period clear exactly period likely order hundred millisecond second current situation relatively low limit compared request scale cpu request load profile spiky believe seeing throttling occur short period time consequence limit processing time high load causing application respond slowly prevents horizontal scaling threshold reached never spin new pod spread load consequence hope setting high cpu limit request allow pod get adequate cpu time time heavy load turn allow horizontal scaling threshold reached allowing persistently high load distributed multiple pod
