raw data command event problem statement working command handler always working object therefore object present handler may either fetch repository based identifier pas part command selected solution take account command may dispatched external system processed asynchronously driver always operate actual state object ease integrate external system consistent cqrs pattern considered passing raw data object command object passed command event may desynchronize main object causing problem handler may operate wrong data passing object command ease implement new feature make faster solution give plenty problem integration external system operating actual state object especially asynchronously good easier implement new feature bad command handler work synchronized object bad problematic async communication bad hard integrate command written like external system passing raw data identifier object want change etc based identifier object easily fetch resolve problem desynchronizing always make query newest state object good problem desynchronizing data async communication good easily integrate external system good consistent cqrs pattern bad always make query get object want modify caching query doctrine orm outcome chosen passing raw data identifier object want change etc give plenty advantage small problem always making query want work object
