title experimental feature area core administration storefront tag process backwards compatibility currently hard publish feature early state gather feedback regarding feature useful improved etc one major reason everything publish marked internal part backwards compatibility promise thus changing foundational part feature quite hard first release lead feature developed quite time without getting actual feedback user able release implemented pretty final state order confidently release stable manner keep backwards compatibility time also mean current approach beneficial ecosystem whole backwards compatibility promise benefit feature built behind closed curtain cant chime idea case regarding extendability etc example feature could benefit earlier experimental release could release multi account feature simple employee management system first add complex budget management access control top later advanced search could release first version new advanced search feature without configuration customizability might envision case releasing first increment feature without experimentalflag would mean would keep backwards compatibility whole feature even later decide change implementation feature thus making development feature harder also getting feedback customer additional functionality needed released first foundational increment feature base prioritization real customer feedback thus ship business value sooner customer lower risk building wrong thing ship feature earlier add concept experimental feature thus giving early access meaningful increment feature still active development mean particular backwards compatibility promise experimental feature thus change implementation needed without worry breaking change mark code feature new experimental annotation make clear code level api yet stable code already expect never become part public api internal annotation directly make sure even feature stable continue tread part code internal keep backwards compatible everything marked experimental designed part public api feature stable time offer way ecosystem give early feedback feature well test project especially extension developer check might want integrate extend feature built thus suggest needed extension point development process make possible mean also documentation api doc dev doc user doc experimental feature experimental feature developed specific target version beginning version feature considered stable apis kept backwards compatible mean experimental annotationattribute removed version released hard estimate exactly release feature may stable also depends feedback get make sense mark stable next major version mean feature wont finished stable earlier remove experimental minor version mean latest version considered stable prevents situation lot feature stay experimental state long time experimental promise experimental feature dont compromise term quality guideline mean experimental feature production ready process functionality single feature may change considerably experimental phase wont discard data generated feature actively previous stage meaning even change underlying data migrate existing data ensures customer early version feature continue working feature said earlier experimental feature hone backwards compatibility promise allowing react flexibly feedback gather based earlier iteration feature killing feature may happen development feature get feedback feature idea provide value expected case may kill feature case mark feature deprecated next major version even feature marked experimental fall backwards compatible promise remove experimental feature minor version kill feature next major version announce deprecation soon possible also important feature cant stay experimental state forever mean either developed stable state killed next major version compare old feature flag approach old feature flag approach workinprogress code hidden feature flagging mechanism meant code production ready released product turned via flag experimental feature neither work progress finished finalized feature whatever included experimental feature production ready ready customer may mean functionality envision feature ready yet standalone optin experimental feature always technical perspective experimental feature always deactivated reduces number permutation system greatly reduces overall complexity thus make testing etc lot easier perspective external developer make thing also predictable external rely feature given version independent specific system configuration thus help getting real feedback ecosystem merchantsusers perspective might case might beneficial early feature optin already detailed section adr focus merchant perspective leaf open future adr however made make certain feature optin user always built way new feature hidden technical perspective whole feature always optin make entry point new feature visible user consequence core add experimental annotation similar internal annotation indicate part code class method level yet stable thus covered backwards compatibility promise additionally experimental annotation stableversion property feature made available stable latest experimental stableversionv mean latest major version feature stable removed however experimental annotation always removed earlier experimental feature considered technical debt strive stabilize feature soon possible feature stabilized targeted major version experimental phase extended case case basis static analysis rule unit test check every experimental annotation stable version property experimental annotation version already released similar test case deprecated additionally checker adapted handle experimental annotation way handle internal annotation attribute following reason similarity annotation like deprecated internal symfony also experimental annotation see example documentation experimental code annotation php template code dont evaluate annotation runtime attribute annotation wont bring much benefit database migration said earlier data experimental feature migrated underlying structure change customer data lost additionally also provide bluegreen compatible migration system mean destructive change layout dropping table column done major version happen immediately bluegreen compatibility overall system
