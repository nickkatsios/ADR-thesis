adr define work flow label issue proposal created github issue heavily kind thing reporting bug requesting feature discussing idea tracking work recording failed test recording thing etc pull request technically issue well github treat separately part issue pull request share set label milestone search interface way assign people issue also github project board kanban style board useful organize track work make priority clear usually repository set issue pull request issue disabled thing work flow well defined track issue repo issue centralize somewhere handle label label mean assigned handle assignee mean assigned issue adr cover handle issue label assignee milestone scope adr decided separately related release planning workflow data issue current label definition label see snapshot current label proposal proposal supposed answer open question create better definition issue label starting point idea decide initial definition document evolve time pull request documentation adrs documentation would look like according proposal added pull request issuesmd adr provides rationale location issue repository set issue aggregated one central repository rationale keep issue close code pull request refer make easier get overview issue specific repository doesnt confuse people look one repository might lack repos label required per repository repospecific label one assignee person working issue assigns themself issue show active work issue talk others intend work related issue active work issue assignee issue grab anybody pull request submitter pull request usually person working explicit assignee pull request therefore optional somebody else author taking work pull request add themself assignee ask maintainer add title title issue short expressive description issue issue grouped label dont prefix build feature task list task list issue pull request keep track sub task small put issue nice way keep closely related thing together indicator progress get good overview progress shown issue list github label label represent information different dimension helpful make specific information issue visible classify issue easier listing filtering assist workflow issue handled following section define type label different dimension type component includes description dimension label supposed list corresponding label list label based current set label brings consistent format defines label add change remove represents snapshot current label starting point label maintained github adr describes general convention name structure adding changing individual label future wont require adr done github well look automating canonical version controlled definition label git discussed changed via usual development workflow label meant available across repository repository label fine label fit overall definition label help triaging incoming issue preparing work done getting quick overview able filter according different category essential label also help finding old issue pull request issue pull request labeled accordingly assigning label help process become exercise sake assigning label color label group see example robin general convention spelling label lowercase word separated space label split several sublabels indicated colon test broken test floating keep sorted together list selecting label assignment filtering label indicate certain workflow add finegrained information already handled github open closed review pull request pull request backport bitcoin change supposed contributed upstream backported bitcoin change successfully contributed upstream wip wip work progress supposed merged yet issue design design possibly uip implemented waiting feedback new waiting feedback removed wontfix duplicate invalid make sense closed issue comment say closed nice way sight mind adr adrs linked issue type indicates type issue issue must exactly one type issue type similar content format process bug problem existing

test test floating floating test automated test occasionally fails removed question trivial nothing trivial software category label indicate general category usually tied specific part code help grouping issue together example project board filtering work done specific people specific way security issue issue zero one multiple category repo configuration repository build build system test

wallet unitedocs adr record doc general documentation doc user end user documentation doc operator operator documentation doc developer developer documentation welcome issue become good practice indicate issue good starting point new people several convention settle one natively supported github good first issue good issue start somebody new project removed help wanted redundant platform flagging platform specific issue platform linux linuxunix platform mac macos platform window window platform freebsd new adopt proposal defined section proposal document definition handle issue dtrorgunitedocsprojectissuesmd consequence documentation added label renamed removed added label description added label prefix title replaced label clonemachine issue enabled clonemachinerelated issue moved unite repo clonemachine repo mergeable configuration adapted result clearer consistent easier understand view issue eventually obvious way documentation serf reference definition required daily work reference bit documentation good material issue example project good way reference httpissuelabelingcom good general guideline example good description label
