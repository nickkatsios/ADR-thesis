managing memory workspace state workspace memory include thing like memory managing scope tracking allocation deallocations managing internal structure gradient memory memory storing gradient backpropagation training dljs workspace track different type gradient memory including standard gradient external gradient deferred gradient note misuse cause memory leak following way closing workspace properly workspace properly closed cause memory leak happen user forgets close workspace exception occurs workspace closed catch block workspace long workspace long cause memory leak happen workspace reused many time cleared holding onto reference reference object created within workspace held onto long cause memory leak happen object released workspace longer needed many workspace many workspace created cause memory leak happen workspace created unnecessarily properly managed incorrect workspace configuration workspace configured incorrectly cause memory leak happen workspace allocated enough memory allocation policy set correctly consequence advantage memory allocation workspace allow preallocation memory avoid overhead associated dynamic memory allocation training memory reuse reusing allocated memory rather allocating new memory operation workspace help reduce memory fragmentation improve performance scope management workspace created within particular scope closed longer needed allows efficient memory management prevents memory leak automatic deallocation workspace closed memory allocated within workspace automatically deallocated freeing memory resource operation multiple workspace dlj allows creation multiple workspace useful running multiple model training process simultaneously disadvantage increased code complexity implementing workspace code add additional layer complexity require careful management workspace creation usage memory overhead workspace require overhead workspace creation management tracking increase memory usage workspace size limitation since workspace preallocated fixed size may case allocated size sufficient larger model datasets limit performance accuracy training process training slowdown depending specific case workspace implemented may case workspace could actually slow training process rather speed learning curve workspace effectively requires good understanding work manage properly may require additional learning training time
