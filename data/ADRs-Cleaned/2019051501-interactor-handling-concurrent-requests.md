interactor handling concurrent request application generally handle concurrent request coming different device adapter interactors dependency dont depend request parameter interactor instance every request case however interactors dependency depend detail request example concrete presenter injected interactor place presenter interface depends output model specific request specific device adapter handling current connection case interactors dependency might identity example service specific configuration like logger database driver etc shouldnt created anew every time theyre injected interactor instance interactor shared wed also face concurrency issue different request would sharing resource finally different request might coming parallel routing interactor handled proper manner design point view request require different concrete presenter meaning different interactor general request mean application component theory duplicated different request controller presenter view interactors interactors dependency two main drawback one related design performance design perspective might share dependency identity like service specific configuration among different interactors assume dependency injected solve properly configure container resolve certain reference always instance time new interactor created service passed constructor design system independent performance issue example decide construction certain dependency expensive replace service proxy decorated version caching whatever solution decide however shouldnt impact design system proposed consequence design greatly simplified remove requirement application layer unique every connection thus remove broker component system design performance issue kept properly separated service application even closer native application term design difference number duplication application duplicationone instance native application several service application high level design structure staying
