type decide data structure identifier domain entity guid type reason distributed system simple integer type would work case database server responsible generating scaling server multiple instance requires synchronization ensure generated guids solve problem unique definition acceptable collision rate also created client instead requiring centralized service downside guids take lot space relative integer also dont lend well indexing considering distributed nature system hilow algorithm twitter snowflake algorithm would viable solution
