usecase adr defined app signal event holochain app push make sure uis receive pushed notification holochain node requirement seems advantage world rich apps run bridging sophisticated app composability feature conductorcomposer client running kind connecting iot device able connect holochain apps easily mandatory fullnode holochain instance online time tied browser process available dht make unattractive run whole instance web browser desirable bidirectional communication pubsub client side possible subscribe certain event node receives new data receives message etc exposed object abstraction browser runtime like web also connect remote node compatability holo considered solution daemon conductor accepts function call via restful http request solution implemented proto single daemon conductor expose endpoint calling function namespaced app zome benefit rest simple easy understand every web developer know easily find tutorial interface rest api rest interoperable literally hundred thousand rest library across useful programming language easy open postman insomnia even curl fire request see happens maintainance holochain specific sdks becomes nice rather permanent gate basic usage new client languageenvironment rest stateless easy reason state connection connection state outside immediate data transfer rest defines clear convention addition lowlevel connection detail also clear set noun verb api specification year convention established wild tradeoff holochain state change polled client push update backend possible polling backend least proto local agent easily example libpp implement exponential back hit twice per second easy several loop client polling various endpoint secondary drawback proto version http request include lot contextual information header etc arent handled right dont clear right way handle holochain daemon conductor expose websockets bidirectional communication instead http keep permanent websocket connection client holochain node define protocol websocket client take advantage conductor feature talking multiple apps make session permission system expose certain apps capability remote uis websocketstreaming permission system commonly work topic basis pubsub rather resourceverb basis like rest benefit seems needed least holo holochain keeping open connection clientholoport long possible make lot sense lot reason performance routing analytics etc websockets send data much overhead http connection established client server push data adhoc allow backend push data websockets scale best server parallel connection opened per client sse long poll support parallel connection per client whether parallel connection would enough highly speculative point pretty good browser support notably websockets allows implementation connection lifecycle server detect respond dropped connection tradeoff websockets low level relatively little opinionsconventions represent connection state transferred data rest state management data callback pingpongclose must implemented handled clientserver pairing implementation client becomes tied implementation server rest defines data structure server implement websockets requires data structure lifecycle management line handling droppedlosthanging connection automatic specified websockets probably big benefit holo offer explicit control connection lifecycle extra workcomplexity vanilla holochain clientserver setup care must taken avoid stale websocket state piling backend garbage collected effectively pull data websockets must faked perimplementation basis lining requestresponse data end practise lot library offer box worth aware websockets viewed debug tool chrome network tab much harder work hand rest typically way work websockets editing running live code relying debug output websockets relatively advanced topic web developer longer bleeding edge dangerously archaicniche also documentedunderstood ubiquitous level rest websockets break commercial load balancerscdns generally complex impossible setup proxying holochain issue websocket server client typically machine holo may problematic depending network ultimately configured realistic usage websockets bind clientside development usage holochain specific sdks whether official unofficial sdk available languageenvironment python ability access server daemon conductor expose rest server sent event sse push communication work rest implement server sent event push data client subscribed sse part html part eventsource interfacespec benefit automatic reconnection handling work load balancingcdns preserve benefit rest api data sse notify client change previously subscribed tradeoff limited parallel connection lower browser support websockets notably absent ieedge product available polyfill roughly support websockets per websockets particularly easy debug hand heartbeat must provided maintain connection automatic reconnection handling might bad thing holo said handling doesnt align daemon conductor expose rest long polling client long polling sophisticated hacky depending pov approach simple poll loop client long poll setup client request data server sends data available hold open connection connection held open new data becomes available sent open connection may time new data becomes available client reopens connection soon closed due either receiving new data timeout benefit work browser simple riff standard polling technique stateless scalable connection parallel connection clientside garbage collection memory stale connection tracking needed serverside still requires state server track meant new data becomes available perclient basis easy debug understand develop clientside way rest client handle reconnections complex lifecycle state management heartbeat etc tie development mandatory sdk although developer would aware connection left open data available could easily toggled onoff depending application client standard rest polling long poll tradeoff client handle reconnections may undesirable holo client attempt reconnect next item data must routed holo backend somehow connection overhead relative websockets whether real issue depends volumefrequency reconnectionspushes daemon conductor communicating browser plugin via ipc similar metamask ethereum communicating local node via ipc plugin expose holochain call javascript running page via injected object plugin communicates daemon via ipc file similar benefit sure yet substantial advantage hold available may benefit storage backends nothing obvious perspective data pushpull tradeoff requires endusers install plugin requires development plugin impossible client cannot install plugin python postman curl etc holochain conductor run custom browser expose call directly comparable mist browser ethereum currently implemented qml frontends holosqape could redone web technology electron holochainnodejs benefit similar plugin remove ipc brings world webbased crossplatform native application tradeoff would continue running background window open requires development custom browser doesnt empower clientside development outside custom browser probably better implemented electron apps sitting top one clientside solution discussion also possibility implement multiple ethereum might practical many people working core real problem first start existing

long term holo serverclients native electron apps woo consequence websocket interface designed upcoming adr implemented app developer alternative qml based uis web based uis build run separately
