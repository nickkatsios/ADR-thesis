restructure govukfrontend repository prepare codebase weve agreed make following change file repository location create govukfrontend govukfrontendreview package create govukfrontend npm package move source file currently src built package file currently package package keep shipping built file npm well file field packagejson include directory shipped package npmignore exclude specific file like test create govukfrontendreview package review app store package folder create shared config lib task helper package remove built package file currently package version control update release process make sure keep checking change possibly manually package released previous version leave dist current location may revisit whether version control root future compiled file without npm yield following structure repository govukfrontend repository root dist built file without npm package parent folder package govukfrontend govuk frontend package dist previously package generated build file version control ship npm src previously src source file version control shipped npm task build release gulp task govuk frontend package packagejson ensures dependency src dist task insync govukfrontendreview review app package dist version control task review app build test example src previously appsrc source file review app task build watch task review app packagejson shared parent folder package shared across monorepo config previously config store config info like filepaths port helper helper function development lib previously lib shared library task previously task shared task src contains symlinks new source file location packagejson workspace configuration toplevel dependency rationale creating govukfrontend govukfrontendreview package overview package ship form publish govukfrontend npm deploy govukfrontendreview heroku make sense group package folder convention seen across repos also allows better organise dependency two govukfrontend may ship dependency future example peer dependency polyfill library shipped version compiled import statement polyfills rather polyfills bundled dependency library shipping babel preset postcss configuration moving source built file within package help ensure dependency resolved consistently dont yet dependency moving file change shape package requiring user update import path nunjucks making breaking change taking advantage breaking nature release set dont worry future dependency doesnt force ship source file weve decided exclude least choose folder include via file field packagejson npmignore exclude specific file govukfrontendreview review app relative path src access component govuk frontend cannot make consume govukfrontend exact way user downloading npm registry get pretty close workspace making govukfrontend directly help ensure consuming built file rebuilding source process keep sync govukfrontend package built actual file work intended entry packagejson properly configured dependency get resolved expected well still different route test peerdependency introduce though creating config helper lib task package internal tooling package dont ship across shipped package grouping shared folder convenience main benefit splitting way dependency organisation removing built package file version control since consuming govukfrontend govukfrontendreview app rebuild govukfrontend package regularly rather point release leave built file version control wed risk committing built file somewhere previous release next one removing ensures rebuild updating release process including built file version control serf way check there weird code sneaking change package get highlighted review pull request raised commit new build package release well keep checking unexplained change package release even manually diffing automation leaving dist current location dist doesnt move enable previous point amount change well leave equation risk constraint may namedbased confusion previously package folder build rather manually edit file package folder contains source similarly well dist folder root well package folder mitigated somewhat removing nonroot dist folder version control might want consider renaming root dist folder something like release external contributor may current structure repository confused relocation help leaving hint readme file symlinks new location considered creating govukfrontend govukfrontendreview package keeping review app app folder repurposing package folder govukfrontend package would create naming confusion since previously package automatically built code wed splitting package across base directory shared package might bit confusing holding govukfrontend source file built package file within package would mean waiting next breaking change may peer dependency release creating config helper lib task package moving shared folder package folder location shared folder kept root distinguish shipped package package folder removing built package file version control could also built package separate folder thats version control govukfrontendlocalbuild ensure consume built file without impacting package wed duplicate effort maintain two packagejson file lose testing dependency resolution package export complicate linting dependabot update could get package deployed github npm registry allowing installation review app line requires extra infrastructure though doesnt help running locally implication user update import path migrating document part release notesmigration doc ongoing new component exit page tasklist source relocated merged new code structure help moving thing release exit page support branch keep making sure configuration govuk prototype kit get recognised kit pick file necessary contributor brett kyle
