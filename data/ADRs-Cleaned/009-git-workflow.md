git workflow updated order maintain principle least privilege decided onset project vendor raft would work fork government repo issue pull request government repo fork vendor would write access government repository government circleci account throughout project vendor development work done vendor forked repository pull request government even documentation pull request vendor made directly government repository created situation vendor needed continuously rebase government repository make sure vendor repository result problem git history arisen make confusing government vendor track history work proposed workflow provides remedy issue well many others detailed consequence section contributor tdp project would always following step propose change repository merges directly hhsmain

issue automatically closed government merges ensuring cicd pipeline green consequence benefit dependency chain would much easier manage daisy chain dependency allowing github manage change downline much simply cleanly mybranch depends mybranch open mybranch develop open rafttech mybranch mybranch change latest branch shown reviewer dependent code still present kept github exposing button update upstream branch easily submit smaller since remove much maintenance work currently involved achieve goal complexity contributers reviewer rebase hhsmain back develop much smaller chance needing revert commits hhsmain git history much cleaner much time managing git history review one place entire history branchpr viewable one place allow keep current circleci setup staging place deploy development server code merged develop test deployment ahead opening hhsmain implement github hook automatically issue hhsmain one merged develop maintain least privilege restricting vendor write access gov repo circleci test automated deployment merging hhsmain risk one pull request time able hhsmain wont problem since issued approved therefore merged immediately comment vendor repo rather government repo important link native keep track conversation hhsmain note overarching tdp workflow followed prior opening hhsmain come rafttechdevelop unless absolutely needed case lfrohlich adpennington must review
