gpio currently lot integration based gpio including spi bus integration low usage count source home assistant analytics add amount maintenance review time core integration unmaintained gpio via container including home assistant container supervised installation method often unstable complicated support gpio specific platformssbcs mileage varies raspberry bit platform sensor general better supported done via dedicated project like esphome longer accept integration integrate device gpio identify deprecate remove integration gpio still possible custom integration gpio gpio case mean interfacing directly individual gpio pin line board running home assistant includes bus communication like spi device connected gpio exposed system regular serial device exempted adr consequence longer accept integration integrate device gpio core integration maintained custom integration project like esphome instead
