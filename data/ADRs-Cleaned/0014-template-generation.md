generating odata client template proposed odata client generator currently based tsmorph library provides functionality programmatically navigate manipulate typescript code proposal base generation typescript code javascript native string template consequence focus tsmorph navigating existing code generating new code point benefit switch templatebased approach performance first test showed make pure generation typescript code time fast including parsing time faster seems similar including transpilation although final result yet readability convenience without tsmorph dont handle additional layer abstraction brings along useful analyzing code really necessary generating code native string template free structure suit purpose name accordingly vdmentity abstraction enough deduct resulting file new team mate wont get tsmorph api without additional abstraction template become frame closer final code allows developer easier understand actually looking also little power formatting template approach directly modify generated string currently additional lint step could left improving performance bit testability currently generated code quite difficult test test either match tsmorph structure involve save generated code read string test small chunk generation easily comparing string becomes even easier snapshot testing
