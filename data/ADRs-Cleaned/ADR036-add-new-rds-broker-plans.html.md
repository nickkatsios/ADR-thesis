look usage existing database concluded part existing plan appropriate current usage didnt identify database could easily smaller instance size higher iop one hypothesis evidence form support ticket current small plan dont enough iop causing people prematurely upgrade medium aws warn creating disk due iop restriction seems sensible shouldnt provided plan smaller moment price postgres tiny small medium instance plan price month tiny small smallha medium mediumha increase disk size small instance current would cause small plan increase roughly follows based ireland price plan price month tiny small smallha medium mediumha small database mean changed disk existing plan tenant would pay extra month flip side might able stick small plan longer better iop alternatively could add new pair plan like smallhighiops smallhahighiops would allow upgrade path small smallhighiops medium instead current small medium would avoid people paying cpu memory dont separately add support postgres mysql

instance type since there reason adding new plan old instance type story may turn priority change instance type existing plan considered whether upgrade existing database new instance make new database old version postgres mysql get latestgeneration instance type decided would tricky administer change nice new instance type incentive people upgrade consequence small database newer engine version postgres mysql expensive disk tenant may able stick small database longer upgrade medium plan saving money tenant able get higher performing database newest engine version postgres mysql possible implement downgrading medium small database new plan broker since sized disk could save tenant money optimise database usage discover could move medium small plan postgres mysql
