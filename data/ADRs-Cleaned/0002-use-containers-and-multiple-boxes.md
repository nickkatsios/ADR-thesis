container multiple box aim project allow team quickly create jenkins platform running aws jenkins masteragent architecture single master node trigger job running multiple agent concern deploy configure manage master agent make master agent docker container running separate managed instance provision manage directly without orchestration service like kubernetes separate instance separate instance master worker increase security making impossible code running worker job affect master addition allows team increase capacity adding extra worker box required docker master running master docker make easy deploy upgrade improves team ability quickly respond new jenkins version released response security vulnerability example addition docker mean configuration kept git repository along rest code rather managed via jenkins docker agent running worker docker container allows isolation job ensuring job start known state making possible target specific configuration via jenkinsfile increasing security making impossible job affect underlying orchestration framework although team experimenting jenkins service simple enough worth introducing added complexity project consequence current architecture allow job create new docker image part step team functionality jenkinsfiles require change supporting would possible creating additional worker mount docker socket box within agent container although may security implication
