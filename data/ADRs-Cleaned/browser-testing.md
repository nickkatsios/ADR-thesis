browser testing pupose document copmprehensive strategy dealing browser test include technology implemented document first pas investigation library may suggested added repo mentioned library section discussed document also outline remaining question made team issue library browser test test test run library many browser testing library often different one allow write test typescript performant

glitter submit told recieved sparkle year old favourite colour glitter syntax would make quite quick writ test large maintenance cost implementing code run test line function tell browser added cost high library offer real advantage nightwatch testcafe browser test test two type test test different thing definately run different step every build main difference two browser test testing logic interaction across set browser testing user story accross client server browser test quick run single browser run remote branch mocked back end test interaction communication client server example upload many document validation warning appear disable upload button run parallel end end test run final buit artifact ideally run last merge master reject merge fail alternatively run test user story never test feature test issue reported prevent regression test data stored sql file populate database never conflicting example test deletes submission interfere another open submission editting ideally run parallel written sparingly tie resource page object navigate test allows much concise test prevents lot duplicated code test run test ideally run every push remote however unrealistic given amount time take run run pas code merged fully master look hook travis github allow revert merge fails merge master branch running test test also runnable localy full browser headless one would good also running docker image build run allow debugging issue faster issue made test run library
