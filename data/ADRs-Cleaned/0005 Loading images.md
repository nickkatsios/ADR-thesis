library image loading write image loading code considered picasso glide none write code outcome chosen picasso produce highly performing image loading code one try reinvent wheel library open source well maintained year positive consequence code cleaner code high performance highly adopted negative consequence dependency ever deprecated work needed pro con picasso good lower footprint good lower footprint method count good load image slightly faster bad memory glide bad higher footprint bad higher footprint method count bad load image slightly slower good memory bad contain bug bad maintained bad wont perform well good dependency link picasso glide comparison picasso glide
