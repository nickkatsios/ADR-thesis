adr snapshot verification created initial snapshot download spawning new node downloads blockchain verifies start properly participating network necessary identify double spends unspent transaction output spent take considerable amount bandwidth time sync computing power verify order node join network quickly fast sync mechanism would beneficial bitcoin already support pruning mode downloads part blockchain iterates blockchain sliding window manner given time require certain amount disk space still downloads full blockchain scan thus save disk space bandwidth computing power order determine balance wallet unspent transaction output utxos needed spendable money system idea behind initial snapshot download isd simply download set utxos instead whole blockchain utxo set determine spendable fund node start staking proposing validating right away requirement calculating providing snapshot optional feature possible spawn node isd support activated deactivated node version bit feature negotiation ideally additional consesus rule neeed added system liveness system affected fast sync isd mechanism even majority node activate isd network still function security concern node downloading snapshot know whether snapshot legitimate thus network provide simple way verifying downloaded snapshot example hash snapshot given block height downloaded snapshot could verified computing hash comparing known hash value network value unfortunately another critical value like block hash tip active chain thus posing another consensus aspect problem complicated fact feature optional thus every node deliver information malicious node could take node isd activated easier providing false snapshot newly spawned isd node proposal rolling hash ecmh order provide hash snapshot given block height proposal suggests include utxo set hash coinbase transaction every block alternatively considered costly every kth block might epoch size regard finalization frequency snapshot
