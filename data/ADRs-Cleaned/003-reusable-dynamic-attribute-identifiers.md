reusable dynamic attribute identifier lane width surface dynamic attribute might change number attribute life time road segment lane width surface identified attribute identifier handing new attribute identifier upon change could cause exhaust attribute identifier space rapidly keep track attribute identifier handed road segment lane width surface separately upon change number dynamic attribute try exhaust previously identifier first reuse additional attribute identifier needed allocate continuing next free attribute identifier across road segment soon identifier allocated becomes dedicated road segment remains even road segment removed consequence reduce rate consume attribute identifier downside behavior downstream consumer take account future improvement could involve pooling identifier removed road segment
