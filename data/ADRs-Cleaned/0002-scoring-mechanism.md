scoring mechanism confidence score useful evaluating output model enables user put varying degree faith model prediction allows certain performance metric sadly spacy ner model architecture output confidence score way around unsatisfying produce low quality confidence score therefore another method gaining confidence score required chosen create model take input spacy ner model predicted entity output confidence score architecture model decided yet explore simple glms first trying neural model consequence creating model require time resource slow speed spacy pipeline risk achieving sufficient level accuracy possible within scope project however gaining confidence score result better ground evaluating spacy model ultimately responsible solution
