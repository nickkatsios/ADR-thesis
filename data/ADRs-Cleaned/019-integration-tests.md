described one two goal support programming critique product test support programming developer safeguard development system written run often development help developer identify unintended sideeffects

development test find bug help identify way system made better enduser consider idea matrix following example lisa crispin show quadrant example type test applying test left half quadrant generally valuable automate consider known path system expected behaviorsresults codify run every time change made system order give confidence release test right half quadrant generally try seek answer unknown behavior system expectation people trying uncover issue test assumption rather implementation therefore test power human subjectivity wholly effective supported tool ultimately manual test type automated test simplify quadrant categorize automated test unit test test technologyfacing support programming test fastfeedback key cover isolated case individual part system mock much reasonable integration test test businessfacing support programming test automated provide fastest feedback possible emphasis placed accurately modeling user experience workflow mock little system possible

ultimately valuable test test verifies much system possible functionality tested also sure consider tradeoff reliability speed tool selenium browserautomation tool cornerstone automated testing industry quite time pro extensive language support documentation community support con requires lot setup common task especially modern application waiting element organizing page object selector etc con flaky especially modern async frontend application inflexible runtime difficult run cypress another browserautomation tool seek simpler developer address gap capability older tool test modern asynchronous application arhitectures pro growing community adoption support major framework architecture pro substantial runtime improvement selenium native support async frontends work well locally cypress dashboard provides test replay analysis con cypress doesnt support testing one superdomain mean redirects logingov authenticate supported authentication workarounds generally required pro tool would allow cucumbergherkin write frontend test scenario plainlanguage step document system behavior businesslanguage useful test type test team expressed interest expanding integration testing suite wellrounded unit test suite address quadrant lacking business scenario test run develop another deployed environment test system endtoend type test would provide continuous regression testing improve release confidence recommend creating new endtoend integration test suite mock least amount system possible test perform action launching browser going actual step user would perform task system tool cypress improves endtoend testing game lot providing simple interface requires minimal configuration selenium suite require lot commandline configuration cypress simply remove allowing focus writing quality test still understand basic testing browser automation tool order make overall cypress lower barrier entry automated testing make test easier write debug provides welldocumented wellsupported environment requiring minimal configuration reason recommend cypress test run test run locally much possible development ensure change dont unexpectedly break something else system test least run process add circleci task run cypress test along unit test also regularly run test deployed environment order best simulate production deployment automatically deploy specific environment merges
