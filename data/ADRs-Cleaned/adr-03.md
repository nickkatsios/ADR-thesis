abstraction true file system access azure blob storage restbased client library directly restbased protocol azure file specifically file system azure file file abstract know love year working onpremises operating system like azure blob storage azure file offer rest interface restbased client library unlike azure blob storage azure file offer smb access azure file share smb mount azure file share directly window linux macos either onpremises cloud vms without writing code attaching special driver file system also cache azure file share onpremises file server azure file sync quick access close data allow specifying readonly writeonly permission folder file shared access signature azure blob storage summary blob storage optimized storing unstructured data information doesnt reside traditional rowcolumn database blob come three different type block blob append blob page blob block blob block blob consists one block identified block default storage client limit block size block blob upload file broken several block maximum block size updated via singleblobuploadthresholdinbytes property uploading additional block blob additional block associated specified blob become part blob commit list block include newly uploaded block azurestorageblob gem allows talk azure blob storage ruby method though provides functionality working block blob work type blob would construct http request hand gem method abstract away interaction individual block within blob automatically creates multiple block associated single blob file greater maximum size allowed single block append blob append blob also consists one block optimized appending additional block onto blob block added end append blob block exposed page blob page blob collection byte page optimized random read write operation page blob initialized maximum data size updated specifying offset range match byte page boundary spec target throughput single blob mib per second pro blob storage around longer appears shipped original launch azure web service mean existing conversation around stack overflow toolsplugins working user review present blob storage goto file service employed case require specific additional functionality provided file service lifting shifting existing file system offer simpler basic solution blob storage much cheaper file storage approximately cost per unit data greater maximum storage size file storage pib pib byte con directory hierarchy system within blob storage purely virtual directory merely abstraction delimited name underlying containerblob hierarchy word virtual directory prefix apply file blob name note aws service work storage account bucket container store object blob prefix notation like would blob storage azure file service spec target throughput single file share mibsec certain region mibsec region pro cache azure file share onpremises file server azure file sync quick access file service smb protocol protocol file directory mac window machine therefore file share mapped onto drive machine note blob container also mounted file system blobfuse tool actual advantage blob storage greater potential throughput con launched sept hasnt around long blob storage smaller max size tib tib byte expecting come close size isnt much concern dont appear additional functionality come file service make reluctant want addition number article resource available communicating blob storage set file zipping much greater whats available file service initial understanding blob storage led believe permission could set container level turned wrong ability set blobspecific permission able single container store transcriptionspecific file userrequested zip file ultimately choice blob storage basic simple storage tool give nothing said still like keep azure file service table case turn would benefit additional functionality offer type blob choice would store data file block blob choose store multiple file within single blob file associated block blob would lose ability name individual file hypothetically would possible create database table column block name emulate naming functionality seems far complicated worth addition azurestorageblob gem give simple interface working block blob save trouble write http request final question blob storage doesnt concrete hierarchy beyond storage accountblob container within container directory virtual demarcated prefix file name end problematic complicate file retrieval retrieving file file system virtual directory shouldnt different retrieving file normal file system long blob prefix constructed way reflects organizational system within applicationdatabase trouble file retrieval may helped append blob final blob type still tbd would benefit caching file onpremises
