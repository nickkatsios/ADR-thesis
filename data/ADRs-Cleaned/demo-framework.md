adr choosing framework demo app jean cochrane open source fellow summer part ashlar summer fellowship want build demo app top ashlar suite order provide compelling proofofconcept ashlar suite create reference code addition reference implementation help future user understand build top ashlar help guide development ashlar suite ensure prioritize impactful feature important component development however involves selecting frontend framework build demo app particular important ive never built app scratch frontend framework overhead development high work invested useful unless continue development framework word cost picking wrong framework potentially quite high evaluating framework looking one easy pick build simple app week familiar enough derek kathryn provide code review guidance architecting app exciting learn based criterion evaluated four framework react redux angular ember vuejs vuex review pro con four framework react redux react javascript library building stateful user interface react focus providing core library building component pure javascript markup extension language called jsx also come large ecosystem extension building fullfeatured web apps including redux statemanagement library built core contributor react project pro civic apps team react redux already wellestablished tooling ive interested learning react time ive read quickstart guide already already familiar basic jsx component model react mostly pure javascript markup added form jsx appealing developer perspective since dont like dealing template want experience writing complex javascript although problem many hybrid mobile framework react native comparatively wellsupported library porting react apps mobile would seem open possibility potentially creating native version demo app sometime future con react library framework opinionated handle meat potato thing like ajax call source react redux pairing established pattern particularly around managing global state application still leaf many packaging user mean may harder get handle best practice quickly related point react redux likely clear path building kind app want build incur time researching appropriate package derek kathryn limited experience react redux wont able provide detailed guidance might framework like angular although many post cite react redux simpler learn angular learning curve seems like still quite steep since get acquainted jsx syntax alongside conceptual framework react redux angular angular web app framework written typescript javascript typescript supported firstclass language angular focus providing full suite opinionated tool building complex stateful web apps pro driver written angularjs angular two important benefit many existing ashlar component like schema editor data collector angular apps driver want upgrade ashlar next round development would easy integrate work extend ashlar suite angular bringing schema editor derek kathryn already familiar angular would make code review faster effective con fullfeatured framework angular lot apispecific syntax complicated conceptual architecture ill learn angular react blog post able find come favor react number reason see reading link doesnt necessarily sway since dont put much stock hype opinion consistent enough made impression although typescript required angular angular doc written typescript would want learn sake learning anyway interested learning typescript would increase amount time would take get speed writing code angular angular purport support native mobile application couldnt find documentation website actually proving seems like thirdparty hybrid app framework like ionic even react native ember ember frontend framework building web apps standard modelviewcontroller mvc architecture pro ember seems rely traditional mvc concept like router model view coming django background ill comfortable concept gate con mvc framework ember represents smallest departure concept currently familiar could make development easier also mean excited learn derek kathryn dont experience ember couldnt give detailed guidance ember highly opinionated could contribute project overhead startup cost vuejs vuex vuejs library framework building web apps javascript focus composable view providing core library functionality optionally scale full framework battery included vuex statemanagement library building vuejs apps written core contributor vuejs vuex provides reduxlike pattern managing global state stateful vuejs application pro vuejs small size zipped setup simply include script tag set complicated build procedure vue team considers priority design library incrementally adoptable compared framework vue aim make easy developer part vue app seems appealing potential library like schema editor data collector hope pluggable variety different application fast learning time doc suggest take developer typically day understand key concept start building source vue built standard html templating system also support jsx pattern would allow get started quickly potentially move away html templating time thorough wellpaced fun read documentation vuejs framework considered offered detailed comparison similar framework including comparison react angular ember con native rendering still experimental hybrid mobile app vue unlikely although derek looked vuejs working one app one team extensive vuejs experience couldnt provide detailed guidance similar react redux lessopinionated framework mean itll difficult get handle best practice four framework considered vuejs newest although appears growing quickly community comparatively small stackoverflow tag four framework show angular question react question ember question vue question vue released september based review recommend moving forward vuejs vuex vue seems strike right balance new exciting paradigm learn requiring huge startupinvestment cost even though derek kathryn dont extensive experience vue understanding vues focus simple set core function low initial investment learning mean kathryn derek could still give feedback without much experience could even familiarize core concept quickly enough understand detail addition fact vue team prioritizes incremental adoption seems ideal case given there high uncertainty around ashlar suite look like medium longterm four framework vue seems provide lowest initial investment overhead consequence main contest vue angular consequence primarily choice vue instead angular consequence include much faster get started building app derek kathryn wont able provide detailed guidance offthebat may angular driver ashlar reference app wont built framework although choosing vue demo app wont necessarily mean modernize schema editor data collector app mean likely barring total disaster vue still seems best choice term minimizing path dependence separate ashlar suite driver development reading reference
