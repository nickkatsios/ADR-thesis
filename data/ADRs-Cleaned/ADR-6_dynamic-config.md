adr dynamic configuration configuration validators mounted connaisseur configmap common practice kubernetes ecosystem configmap upgraded say helm upgrade resource kubernetes updated accordingly doesnt mean automatically updated inside pod mounted occurs pod restarted pod still old version configuration lingering around fairly unintuitive behavior reason connaisseur doesnt mount image policy pod instead pod access kube api get image policy dynamically could done validator configuration also another solution problem access configuration connaisseur get access configuration file solution dynamic access solution currently employed image policy configuration validators get customresourcedefinition connaisseur get access resource via rbac kube api read configuration pro pod dont restarted configuration changed fly without helm con kubernetes native approach connaisseur must always network request access config solution restart pod solution would configmaps validators image policy restart pod change configuration achieved setting hash config file annotation deployment change configuration hash change thus new deployment rolled new annotation corresponds suggestion made helm pro kubernetes native customresourcedefinitions con fly change outcome solution chosen going kubernetes native way problem many configmaps many image policy validator configuration either customresourcedefinitions configmaps still separate merged one file solution concern resource resource one image policy one validators solution one rule one ring rule one ring find one ring bring darkness bind outcome solution chosen simpler two
