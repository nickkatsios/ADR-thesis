glusterfs storage container running kubernetes provide ephemeral storage provide persistent storage allows volume mounted multiple container restricts kubernetes volume type support read write many specifically selecting nfs glusterfs rook decided glusterfs provide distributed persistent storage opted rook feel isnt yet ready production usage also would easy deploy hyperconverged would second kubernetes cluster run isolated storage require feel simple nfs storage isnt sufficient wont give data resilience given backup data replication give limited disaster recover capability consequence havent yet confirmed kubernetes integration via heketi may able kubernetes storage abstraction later
