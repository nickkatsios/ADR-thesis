kind architecture record adr finding accessible color creating design token florian sander started clever component project library component design centralisation shared style deliberate trying blindly follow dry dont repeat principle early often lead premature optimisation instead went something similar wet write everything twice decided duplicate style variable color spacing component trying always value everywhere idea wait component trying figure right way manage shared style variable allowed build solid base essential component quickly clearly project ready kind refactoring year regarding initial color idea set component dont look feel different console thats reused color wanted wait console implemented new component switch new improved color optimistic important improvement contrast ratio could addressed sooner component developed people contribute centralised design way enforce design consistency become essential problem accessibility first issue wanted tackle contrast ratio colour blue green red color contrast ratio required big text way required regular text color component especially inside button found everywhere consistency maintainability listed color accross component found shade main color consistency specific reason also found different color code system reason sometimes color could hex code inside component hsl another made even difficult change color theming customisation since component share variable color impossible modify adjust possibility modify color first essential step towards theme customisation would allow dark mode instance solution find new accessible color first needed find accessible color replace blue green orange red color criterion color selected needed reach least contrast ratio associated white match color legacy part console draw attention without standing much note selected color reached least contrast ratio associated white wanted color could big regular text color big text contrast ratio would made thing complicated went darker color avoided adding much saturation new color would stand much legacy color still existing console menu background instance tool find color relied color review tool found thanks stphanie walter blog list many great tool number color chose keep shade main color blue green orange red main color text color plain background would make stand rest light shade color background make text stand much grey color needed least shade since many different case shade text shade background shade differents state background like disabled active hovered etc know may add shade color later want select add needed create design token design token concept come salesforce team defined follows design token visual design atom design system specifically named entity store visual design attribute place hardcoded value hex value color pixel value spacing order maintain scalable consistent visual system development source salesforce design token work design token based two article design token help lukas oppermann naming token design system nathan curtis article helped grasp concept design token find architecture strategy would fit note color design token first step see whats next section abstraction level example came accross insisted building design token technology agnostic relied tool transform token variable could consumed specific technology web native mobile platform etc made sense big project distributed accross several different platform project little bit different team made developer dont specific design tool component web close possible standard reason chose rely variable avoid additional tool like style dictionary would added complexity actual benefit necessary something could easily reconsider later variable naming architecture creating variable tried think much possible developer experience theming customisation design token help article helped lot build system could scale allow customisation later article author distinguishes two kind token choice color instance root colorblack implementation color instance root colortextdefault varcolorblack choice never directly inside component value variable turn inside component creating variable several advantage named correctly guide developer avoid mistake instance colortextdefault developer know color text background represents default color text token name related value name still valid even change value especially planning dark mode instance matter whether colortextdefault black white variable value overridden without problem whereas overriding colorblack value white color value would make thing confusing developer enforce kind basic accessibility rule color usage instance since lightest shade color contrasted enough default white neutral light grey background variable referring color text background whats next accessibility text icon cctileinstances component still legacy contrasted enough handled scalability rework see issue focus style color icon color apps addons menu dashboard theming customisation allow customisation theming mean allow external override variable may switch defining inside javascript template string lit file enforce default background default text color inside component moment exception provide way customise value considering simpler let developer define default text background component simply setting inside component inherit parent changed allow value customised design token color first set design token others listed issue design token documented customisable also document accessible combination
