aws provide storage rds rds storage allow decrease storage database instance increase storage database instance without adding least identified several inconsistency issue current plan studying order volume size problem potential replacing plan section refers renaming existing plan deprecated suffix marking private scoping existing space creating new one old name new configuration way avoid problem billing existing service instance plan problem upgrade path available medium highiops plan large plan rds storage increase rule would violate could replace medium highiops plan one smaller

want upgrade medium highiops large nonhighiops user doesnt understand disk space iop link might medium highiops rama bigger cpumore connection decide straight large highiops instead plain large could add iop information plan description description already quite wordy would make thing worse could nothing leave problem xlarge highiops plan provide disk larger needed achieve maximum aws iop could
