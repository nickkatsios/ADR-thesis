move away static site approach starting build cljdoc somewhat reluctant accept idea managing service people would rely spare time lead architecture doc built otherwise inaccessible server deployed great uptime problem approach quickly became obvious time made tweak documentation rendered would rebuild documentation hard blocker given current iteration speed move away rendering documentation file serving via rendering html requested consequence uptime performance key motivation host doc statically rendering doc server may impact probably require work ensure affected much performance solvable putting cdn front server far response time reasonable cdn may also improve uptime course depends already cached there strict guarantee overall moving towards rendering stuff dynamically allow much faster iteration speed make easier contributor get started locally appendix made around may see commit
