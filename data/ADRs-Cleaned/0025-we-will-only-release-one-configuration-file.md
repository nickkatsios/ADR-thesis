release one configuration file historically two way configuring verify service provider environment variable yaml file environment variable application verifyserviceproviderenvyml file resource directory inside jar yaml file would pas path different file command line parameter usually people would example one thats contained repo couple reason extra complexity managing two file due restriction java buildpack cloudfoundry possible specify command line argument java buildpack cant specify path config file werent confident way cloudfoundry manages static file didnt want rely one also philosophical point factor application configured environment made hide configuration jar everything env var way appealing remove verifyserviceproviderenvyml file srcmainresources application default verifyserviceprovideryml file thats included zip command line argument provided application started without command line argument specifying yml file environment variable set startup error gracefully tell user configuration field specified example error configuration field found either set environment variable specify configuration file command line argument server pathtoverifyserviceprovideryml establish path verifyserviceprovideryml asking java path jar file containing application class looking parent folder consequence play story make default configuration file work way thats compatible current environment variable based solution going forward maintain one configuration file instead two user learn dichotomy configure env var configure file application still run paas default java buildpack
