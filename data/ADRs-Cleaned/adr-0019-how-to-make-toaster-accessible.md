kind architecture record adr make toaster accessible pierre soyres adr try explain challenge faced implemented toast pattern see adr give feedback user action design new component always try inclusive possible meaning sooner think accessibility better understood toast pattern come design lot accessibility challenge problem toast displayed short amount time user may miss notification placed corner screen therefore people screen magnifier may totally miss reveal intention color green success red error cause issue colorblind people may contain button focusable keyboard focus may lost toast disappears button related critical action user may miss toast disappeared saw even reached screen reader expect dynamic content inserted inside live region element sporadic support implemented issue could addressed quickly understood would make compromise implemented toast color color enough reveal notification intention added icon help colorblind user understand also added alt text icon people screen reader aware notification intention alt text also translated english french depending selected language toast ordering dom cctoast element ordered recent oldest toaster placed bottom screen want toast visually stacked bottom top oldest top however want order cctoast element consistent screen reader announce thing dom order flexdirection columnreverse reverse visual order keeping dom order intact toast timeout one biggest accessibility issue toast pattern brief timeout message visible perfect solution address tried minimize following provide progress bar indicates notification disappear soon provide way pause timeout moving mouse toast focusing keyboard provide way set timeout default timeout set second developer modify value want provide way user modify timeout keyboard navigation made toast focusable user focus toast keyboard toast focused timeout paused close button also focusable activated keyboard close button clicked keyboard focus lost toast dismissed removed dom implement anything issue yet know provide mechanism try focus next toast reset focus body element dispatch kind focus lost event developer implement behaviour aria role one want content announced screen reader without move focus rely live region live region typically set arialive attribute allows specify whether interrupt screen reader arialiveassertive arialivepolite whether announce inserted ariaatomicfalse ariaatomic attribute announce everything live region everytime something inserted inside ariaatomictrue make choice easier add semantics region role attribute added rolealert setting arialiveassertive ariaatomictrue rolelog setting arialivepolite ariaatomicfalse rolestatus setting arialivepolite ariaatomictrue doubt struggle hesitated lot verbose ariaatomic polite arialive wanted screen reader interrupt screen reader consider error sensitive information make screen reader read toast area everytime new toast pop also doubt place role attribute place element dynamically added dom cctoast element place container dynamically added content cctoaster element test support make needed conduct fairly extensive test check screen reader support different combination find detail test section dynamically inserted live region test show role attribute seem work best inserted dynamically word seems robust role attribute cctoaster element instead cctoast element former always present dom latter inserted dynamically role unfortunately found support rolestatus inconsistent insufficient nothing announced jaw firefox also interesting note combination screen reader browser nvda firefox talkback chrome announced ariaatomicfalse meaning new content inserted area announced role log big issue rolelog voiceover macos safari screen reader announces difference content already present live region content inserted instance live region contains toast hello world number insert additional message hello word number announces excepted behavior would announce hello world number faced issue arialivepolite ariaatomicfalse considering decided robust method simulate rolestatus live region arialivepolite ariaatomictrue may reconsider add way user review last toast message make verbose mostly depend support rolelog live region especially voiceover safari macos going learn mentioned make compromise accessibility understood could anything magical would make toast pattern fully accessible convinced toast pattern limitation everytime example isnt suited following case important action added along message important message long action inside toast decided avoid action inside toast cause much accessibility issue instance people may time reach may see consider important action placed accessible place persistent notification already thought next step would make notification
