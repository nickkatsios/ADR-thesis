adr support conditionals composite action recently shipped composite action allows reuse individual step inside action however one requested feature way support keyword goal want keep consistent current behavior want support conditionals via keyword built function like success implementable without calling example jobstatus success rather success currently composite currently work currently limited conditional support composite action pre post step based job support keywords like always failed success cancelled however generic main step support conditionals default regular workflow step run success condition look job see successful run default composite action main step run single step fails composite action composite action halted early care job pre post step composite action job determine run forward well think composite action currently invoking main step checking current composite action successful let formalize concept real idea add actionstatus field github mimic job existing concept actionpath set composite action github composite action main step success function check actionstatus success rather jobstatus success failure work way pre post step composite action change continue check job nested scenario nested composite action follow existing behavior care current composite action parent example let imagine scenario simple nested composite action job regular step composite action run exit always child composite action success run echo print run echo also print success run echo print current composite action failed already child composite action step run example child composite action yet failed run step step fails consistent composite action currently work production main job fails composite action invoked withifalwaysorif failure explored could add currentstepstatus job rather step however come two major downside support field every type step non trivial remove field job added readonly action besides composite would every success weird currentstep value job also explored step required prevent colliding step felt wrong naming smooth fit current convention consequence github new field current composite action support conditionals composite action keep existing behavior user allow expand functionality
