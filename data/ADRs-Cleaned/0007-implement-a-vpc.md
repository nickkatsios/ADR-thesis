implement vpc running serverless could choose operate outside vpc advantage term latency request would keepwarm function ensure network interface provisioned lambda running outside vpc could easily access rds running inside vpc given sensitive nature data involved seems sensible protect running rds inside vpc much easier control ingres egress implement vpc consequence given serverless environment mean lambda provisioning enis access vpc either accept mean latency user incur small extra cost implementing keepwarm function ensure user facing lambda always provisioned
