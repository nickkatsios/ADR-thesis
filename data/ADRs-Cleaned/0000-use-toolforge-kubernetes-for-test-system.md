toolforge kubernetes infrastructure test system project new exact technological future unknown example still dont know nodejs app future clientside app served static asset apache nginx etc also publicly accessible test setup feature tested land main branch also development environment environment environment unique requirement production sure yet whether blubber deployment pipeline deploy query builder node app whether part standard wdqs gui asset toolforge seems like good setup small project due bakedin support serving static asset lighttpd serving node apps changing growing mature one recent feature support dockerized webservices cronjobs kubernetes read cant built dockerfile toolforge want direction would dedicated service cloudvps instead make automatically updated puppet ansible would much work little gain going test setup toolforge served static asset built kubernetes cronjob build asset node docker image toolforge automatically copy public endpoint see exact configuration step consequence taking advantage modern technology like kubernetes job instead gridengine job fairly simple straightforward especially compared dedicated serving either nodejs app apachenginx also similar manner simple clientside apps develop mean would take hour patch actually visible test system modified faster slower depending development environment affected adr discussed another case
