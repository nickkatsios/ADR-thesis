cedar intake asynchronous approach current time writing approach sending data cedar intake api call cedar intake client part action user take work raise question failed call cedar result error returned user time writing handle one call cedar fails action modify also send cedar question hard answer others like error handling retries bit difficult part regular discussion cedar intake api brought asynchronousscheduled approach sending data cedar rather one thats triggered user action might help solve good number problem considered alternative continue modifying user action send data cedar intake api asynchronous scheduled approach sending data cedar intake api outcome chosen alternative asynchronous scheduled approach sending data cedar intake api there probably approach could taken generic approach would action scheduling mechanism outlined adr define job either scan entity sent cedar send specific entity cedar pull item queue populate entity sent cedar follow scheduled job scan pull queue populate easier implement specific upside either approach pro con alternative continue modifying user action send data cedar intake api dont introduce new logic add new step action want modify still would build sort likely asynchronous mechanism handling error anyways asynchronous scheduled approach sending data cedar intake api dont write separate error handling logic nature scheduled job mean retries happen automatically dont modify specific action send cedar part action would complicate testing action make action single responsibility saving data easis reliant existence action scheduling mechanism writing doesnt exist yet
