opentracingcontext class wrap way wrapped loggingtracingcontext looked promising worked two extension basic implementation first involved building custom trace based incoming request logging instead randomly generated trace scalaopentracings loggingtracercontext create commit added initial implementation worked fine second extension involved setting jaeger destination instead logging similar think opentracing compliant destination work though particular method configuration probably vary target commit available there one scala warning compile point idgenerator unused left highlight opentracingcontext doesnt let choose generate trace however jaeger let search tag change jaeger include xamzntraceid trace tag search interface look like initial implementation wound featurejsscalaopentracing httpstracer httpstracer oriented around atagless final implementation tracing requires tracing algebra present lot different place example least requires include tracing activity everywhere mean practice dont much tracing logic around thing within thing tracing afterthought probable encourages better design thinking monitoring instrumentation code written make showing toy example single place computation sort challenging something appears missing notion span central natchez scalaopentracing also open tracing spec also doesnt seem notion tagging trace keyvalue pair also central open tracing spec would probably meet current logonly trace weve already done fancy version incoming trace aws given want able dump trace think absence outofthebox support concerning especially given comparatively high degree difficulty implementing new tracing behavior didnt implement tracing demo repository httpstracer scalaopentracing initial implementation tracing several reason case general risk library theyre maintained seemingly single person however scalaopentracings case least know person maintaining responsible health production system super challenging get started scalaopentracing able get logging tracer running two hour chris able make substantive change order extract header api minute started looking adr later able configure dumping trace jaeger instead logging without considerable difficulty different experience two library natchez advertised quite ready production even hook http hard problem right there ongoing work front look close done also ongoing two month there timeline httpstracer separate vocabulary whats open tracing spec doesnt api writing trace external service consequence well add scalaopentracing backsplash fairly easy getting tracer configured also fairly easy long logging tracer start there infra work necessary want add third party service well choose repository trace wed like xray since mean dont configure deploy another service may also decide log since even would useful reference change necessary add jaeger repository local development well figure want trace could example make color correction mosaic implicits function take implicit trace believe case jaeger repository could set sampler send trace one percent request would mean could deploy really aggressive tracing pay whatever price pay tracing one tile every three map load thats true trace aggressively trace conservatively
