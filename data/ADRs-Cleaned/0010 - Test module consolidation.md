testing proposed proposed adam gibson december testing historically large code base like deeplearningj often involves platform specific code several category documented test architecture adr multiple level testing test ever larger chunk application unit test typically test code smallest possible unit java usually encompasses single class component test meant test component consisting multiple unit working together logical component usually consists class dont cross boundary two component integration test meant test component integrate important job ensure component properly interface endtoend test often also called system test meant test entire system interface application regular user regression test meant mimic specific behavior usage result bug created bug fix reproduce bug expect correct behavior fail first bug fixed pas without change test definition test case accumulate bug report come guard recreating particular bug particular situation eclipse deeplearningj project mostly would call endtoend test want run set test different classifier cuda version cudnn cuda version non cudnn cpu armarm order verify platform specific behavior work intended testing generally thing test behavior compatibility across backends performance regression behavior gradient check failing ops providing wrong result different runtime test standalone spark verifying behavior across different backends even release time timeconsuming errorprone taking hour run test inconsistent oftentimes spark multi threading clashing omp math thread causing crahsesslowdowns proposal put anything considered endtoend test requiring platform specific behavior module test would already tagged would accompanying pomxml accommodated downloading snapshot allow run specified test different classifier goal would allow specifying following parameter command line classifier run group test run version run default latest snapshot future work may extend behavior add performance test well intended workflow would allow following step clone code base test module specify combination test want run platform allows easy configuration creation different script validation along line behavior want run example include run model import test kera tensorflow onnx run spark test run basic dlj test distinction would achieved mix test tag test name filter consequence advantage test become accessible becomes much easier set test suite run different classifier recurring job release testingvalidation specific platform like embedded nanos dont require build binary instead download run binary cross compiled verify behavior allows specifying older version library necessary disadvantage lose old behavior test breaking old assumption causing contributor learn specific way running test requires discipline tagging test fairly complex pomxml required flexibly running test
