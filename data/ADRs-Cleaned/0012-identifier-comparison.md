comparison identifier amended constraint identifier value identifier name key identify application handler must compared engine determine two entity considered equivalent documentation specifies key must nonempty utf string consisting printable character without whitespace previously specify string would compared identifier either mostly entirely immutable generated part source code parsed validated user input keeping current behavior weve decided specify bytewise comparison semantics identifier consequence existing tooling engine implementation configkit inmemory engine implementation testkit changed identifier compared standard comparison operator possible two identifier may appear equal consist different byte sequence example character diacritic mark represented single codepoint versus combining character considered unlikely present problem practice nonetheless worth mentioning onus application developer normalize utf identifier
