parallelization lock horizontally scaled process problem parallelization happen like race condition resource accessed simultaneously multiple process different value process previous one wrote resource support horizontal scaling also allow resource locking resource accessing part transmitting data time space storage portal able feature therefore put contract portalbase lock sort storage maintain lock state additional repository added storage featured method shall islocked lock release utility class method easily write spinlocks time iteration shall added lock shall rather run time different measurement instead unintentionally lock resource consequence pro horizontal scaling easier support portal storage easier implement check prevent resource request overlapping con portal storage feature perform worse without feature
