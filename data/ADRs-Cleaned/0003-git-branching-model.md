gitflow branching model updated switched model implementing full well follow github flow git branching model prior implementing continuous integration process older gitflow branching model structure repository impose git flow development process flow considered model gitflow branching model current github flow outcome currently gitflow branching model older model allows quickly revert previous version test release separate production manually catch regression usually caught test suite thus help guarantee quality hand prevents loss information repository making easier read past development model place however model formal cumbersome github flow since implemented ciprocess switch simpler model therefor adopt github flow positive consequence gain insight history development quality deployed release monitored securely lightweight negative consequence requires stable continuous integration process place
