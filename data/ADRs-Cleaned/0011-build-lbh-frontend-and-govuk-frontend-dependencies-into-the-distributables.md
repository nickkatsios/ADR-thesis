build lbhfrontend govukfrontend dependency distributables tightly coupled lbhfrontend govukfrontend want ensure user different version doesnt cause problem also likely user library direct either lbhfrontend govukfrontend neither support react also sas stylesheets dont want force user tooling also support sas bundle lbhfrontend govukfrontend distributables consequence reduces dependency graph user library reduces amount setup user order hand bundling stylesheets library directly make difficult user reuse style code without reusing class think good tradeoff
