refactor subscription platform frontend nextjs deciders reino muhl ben bangert lisa chan lauren zugai bianca danforth problem statement subscription platform frontend become overly complex making inflexible difficult work resulted longer development time new feature case left unable easily accommodate request relying party additionally app grown number network call causing reduction app performance aim refactor app one network call action finally frontend includes business application logic made component part app unnecessarily complex result frontend flexible harder change maintain solve subscription platform team want move business application logic backend address problem briefly discussed meet current future relying party feature request refactoring existing subscription platform necessary driver faster development applies refactoring necessary subplat well future relying party feature request easier routing subplat team want perform advanced routing allow feature relying party specific checkout page testing etc graphql support improve app performance responsivness reducing number network request promotes consistency across fxa monorepo reuse existing component received generally favourable review existing frontend look feel want keep appearance considered react framework nextjs react framework gatsbyjs react typescript without redux react typescript redux react framework remix outcome chosen react framework nextjs significant amount refactoring necessary accomplish subscription platform goal would good time adopt react framework start mostly clean slate since partially completely meet driver especially easier routing faster development driver regarding nextjs favored gatsbyjs completing adr subscription platform team went prototyping project found two framework remarkably similar capability however due nextjss popularity team mozilla team vote made pick nextjs pro con react framework nextjs react framework nextjs good provides many benefit box without compromising flexibility would require additional library otherwise routing rendering image optimization etc good routing simplicity flexibility see information good built tooling reduces existing bespoke tooling currently good easy learn basic good parent company tool work well nextjs enhance capability turbopack swr etc good large community support popularity good team mozilla good longer redux state management determined complex bad add another dependency layer top react bad new team member requires learning complicated feature bad diverges tooling elsewhere fxa monorepo bad requries significant refactoring starting clean slate simplyfing reusing existing component styling possible react framework gatsbyjs react framework gatsbyjs gatsby similar good bad point nextjs good provides many benefit box without compromising flexibility would require additional library otherwise routing rendering image optimization etc good routing simplicity flexibility see

requries significant refactoring starting clean slate simplyfing reusing existing component styling possible react typescript without redux existing fxapaymentsserver app remove redux good simplifies app removing complexity redux determined complex good would mostly existing technology require new learning team bad rescript cra tooling make difficult upgrade react tooling see fxa bad still require significant refactoring remove redux introduce graphql bad page routing reactrouter complicated react typescript redux existing subscription platform refactor existing code good requires least amount new technology library bad staying redux keep complexity app without much benefit bad still require refactoring introduce graphql remove application logic reduce component complexity bad rescript cra tooling make difficult upgrade react tooling see fxa bad page routing reactrouter complicated needing learn routing library compared filebased routing popular react framework see information react framework remix existing subscription platform refactor existing code good provides improved developer experience neutral provides server side rendering neutral team mozilla neutral confusing nested routing functionality bad production tested mature project next gatsby bad smaller community bad requries significant refactoring starting clean slate simplyfing reusing existing component styling possible information filebased routing react router traditional clientside react routing setup react router youll declare route within component adding component page specifying path corresponding component rendered page work fine lack universal convention also declaring many route becomes hard follow least experience filebased routing dont import page component manually instead define route addingremovingrenaming file within directory called page convention file inside page directory represent route application make easier visualize manage page directory structure reflects existing route also dynamic route special file name nested route subdirectory well discus filebased routing common pattern shortly link nextjs gatsbyjs prototype nextjs gatsby react router adr create new react application setting redesign project adr react toolchain setting redesign
