evaluation resilience framework general framework typically implement timeout circuit breaker fallback pattern bulkhead implemented due node single thread nature although longrunning procedure implemented pool file database general resilience framework play important role java world client likely due exhausted thread bounded resource rather limited hardware resource cpu memory mechanism scaling additional node based monitoring low level resource must place nevertheless even killer argument cascading failure disappears argument resilience framework still applicable fallback provides consistent way exposing fallback help mental model thinking happens downstream system available timeouts applying timeouts still good idea reduce memory cpu outbound port pressure result maintaining potentially infinite parallel request slow admittedly timeouts decrease likelihood cascading failure apply circuit breaker well deal shana downstream system system better sfsf graceful towards system
