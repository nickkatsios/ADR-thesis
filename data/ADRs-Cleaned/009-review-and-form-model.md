review form model author macroz background existing handling process reviewer thought viewing right handler assumed people take part handling see whole application however new limit visibility field reviewer first step took include per field privacy state public private public field shown people take part handling including reviewer private field sent reviewer meant handler decider solves immediate problem letting everyone see everything ideally field could public reviewer private another information private field must copypasted review request comment shared otherwise exist least six possibility solve reviewer part reviewer organization receives review request handler repeating field would new feature field repeat per criterion either user add row field repeated per reviewing organization require handler copypaste relevant data private field reviewer review request quo application contains form field one form model reviewer organization catalogue item extra field application contains form field one form extra field catalogue item review request sent certain catalogue item selected control field shown reviewer model reviewer organization catalogue item separate form application contains form field form catalogue item review request sent certain catalogue item selected control field shown reviewer model reviewer organization catalogue item form model private field separate answer reviewer organization repeating field repeated per catalogue item application application contains form field one form review request sent certain catalogue item selected control repeated field shown reviewer add field type model add multiple answer click plus add row model private field separate answer reviewer organization repeating field repeated per answer multiple answer field application contains form field one form review request sent certain repeated field answer selected control field shown reviewer model reviewer organization rem organization separate catalogue item separate form model common field form included workflow application contains form field form catalogue item form one workflow review request sent certain reviewer organization selected control field shown reviewer application contains form field catalogue item workflow discussion deemed important feature improve disregard nothing modeling field catalogue item seem like sensible direction would introduce exception therefore disregard prefer others modeling field form current application bundling logic bundle catalogue item single application share form workflow seems like natural extension model allow several form included merged naive version form merging duplicate field form smart version merges similar field applicant answer however dont separately model field difficult identify field exactly merged one would make sure field globally distinctive know would around potential form would made shared separate part maintaining form shared part would much work would extension editor well possible variant form merging also forcing shared part separate form lot form field duplicated however applicant must somehow always choose wisely include shared catalogue item fixed shown later another possibility including several form catalogue item one common one private part however still maintenance problem catalogue item well catalogue item may contain form several organization application handler reviewer multiple form sensible extension model certainly requires large change logic around codebase would make new repeating functionality would repeat answer field per applied catalogue item modeling reviewer organization catalogue item seems like business something decide requires organization either able statically know process adding missing one repeating logic sound also consider couple catalogue item let prefer one field type press add row button add row sound also like natural extension type field also repeating field based count previous answer sound sensible kind grouping logic may needed repeat field group abcabcabc aaabbbccc therefore seems like sensible extension consider review request must practice changed due fact reviewing organization cant easily modeled statically email inboxes therefore select organization type sending review request must specified per request private field shown user arrives review per request would part solution either picking catalogue item resource organization answer multiple answer field likely reviewer dont existing rem user account certainly possible select review request time one review email group box requirement reviewing organization job allocation therefore inviting reviewer review connecting person application andor organization must done like invite member function last least indeed want model registry keeping organization rem organization catalogue item andor registry catalogue item could review request targeted rem organization organization would define review email inboxes field visibility reviewer would see public form field also private field organization represent common field put workflow form field add capability close license moment one add resource well workflow let try anticipate multiple form well wish model organization better inside rem also least amount maintenance work delegated reviewer organization task organization creation store name description owner reviewemail minimal crud functionality optionally store also member log inare invited reviewer invitation request reviewer invited email exist rem user send email token connect reviewer correct application andor organization upon logging accepting token detail like member invitation review request field send request email invite field send request organization like invite email organization request sent organization reviewer represent visibility private field privacy addition hide private question well answer make sure form look nice different case part hidden bundling change remove restriction form cart functionality change resource action application model change allow multiple form application model backwards compatible change andor migration decide whether group field answer per form mixed organization catalogue item catalogue item mixed organization workflow form resource different organization owner organization owner create combination workflow decides organization handler processing match also resource refer license another organization owner organization owner see form resource workflow organization owner edit one organization
