virtual platform mediator pattern trying build reusable embedded system framework however many embedded system implementation detail particular underlying hardware detail system become tightly coupled various software element interact directly rtos processor hardware functionality area contained behind generic interface kept knowing increase odds creating reusable software design virtual platform abstraction serve mediator system platformspecific behavior implemented within virtual platform platform contain hardware implementation detail ensuring rest application decoupled detail decoupling work generic driver set platform platform apis basic set defined extensible user software layer interact hardware generic driver interface platformprovided apis ensures software application portable across component across platform implementation assuming api guarantee met new platform consequence keep individual component loosely coupled mediator coordinate activity dont different component know directly virtual platform tightly coupled specific hardware implementation already new hardware implementation requires new platform requiring redefinition interface behavior new hardware new platform meet api guarantee porting simplified end application still work must careful apis provide platform layer still possible create poor platform abstraction make guarantee met specific set hardware reading mediator pattern
