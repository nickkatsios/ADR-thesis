portal dependency injection implementation followup adr general service container dependency injection common pattern create reusable component build upon portal communicate api choice different flow component presumably portal developer want build api client within flow component dependency injection come handy depending implementation also decorate service add freedom modification able provide service container portal node matching psr past allowed easy access service injection flow component psr standard define service container service container builder therefore drop implementation symfony dependency injection replace custom service container symfony enable autowiring autoconfiguration autobinding automatic psr resource loading automatically load flow component drop definition portal consequence pro portal developer likely familiar symfony dependency injection service definition based xml yaml require tight composer dependency fluently different symfony version symfonys dependency injection good documentation symfonys dependency injection support tagged service symfonys autowiring autoconfiguration autobinding resource autoloading allows zeroconfiguration dependency injection box portal developer con portal developer know learn symfony dependency injection related thought looked comparison different dependency injection implementation evaluated criterion performance building performance usage least friction current possible future dependency symfonys implementation isnt best comparison paper allows compilation well known work past also saw frictionless migration symfony version service definition based upon xml yaml
