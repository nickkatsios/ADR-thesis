confusing filter implies filtering address actually filtering business partner alternative filterby businesspartnerrequestbuilder getall filter businesspartnertobusinesspartneraddressfilterby

clearly better longer deep path straight forward implement investigation needed separate entityset api entity version decided required optional function style filtering current api const bupa

businesspartner await businesspartnerapigetall filterbusinesspartnerfirstnameequalspeter executedestination could fix circular dependency could implemented nonbreaking change initially deprecating old

function style filtering point pro cleaner separation responsibility con importing three thing quite complex could avoided function style filtering discussed function style filtering version candidate

might nicer allow function alternative function businesspartnerrequestbuilder getall filterbupa bupafirstnameequalspeter pro javascripty con make much sense without separating api entity schema static
