adr sdl support multiple resolution want support variety screen resolution planning fixed resolution tile render game classic frogger traditionally played grid tile extra space vertical space draw want something similar game internal coordinate represent grid renderer able map resolution one way ive seen solved multiple coordinate system one coordinate system reprersenting pixel screen one coordinate system representing physical location game world game logic would implemented term world coordinate would converted screen coordinate renderer another way solve target specific resolution game logic leverage sdls logical screen feature scale game given resolution attempted spike world coordinate found added lot complexity existing codebase given extra complexity going stick leveraging sdls logical rendering feature solve problem might something revisit future sdl support multiple resolution targeting internal screen consequence screen physic module updated support change
