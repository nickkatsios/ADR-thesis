package manager yarn rationale feature workspace workspace make easy work monorepos allowing multiple package reside repository depend upon architecture allows modification made one package instantly applied dependent without publishing yarn introduced new workspace tool plugin interact workspace via cli plugin allows focused installs resulting quicker installs large monorepos resolution yarn support selective dependency resolution let define custom package version range inside dependency resolution field packagejson manifest file useful case may depending package updated frequently depends another package got important upgrade case version range specified direct dependency cover new subdependency version stuck waiting author subdependency project got important security update dont want wait directdependency issue minimum version update relying unmaintained working package one dependency got upgraded know upgrade would break thing also dont want fork package relying update minor dependency dependency defines broad version range subdependency got problematic update want pin earlier version yarn path yarn instructed defer another yarn binary execution configured via yarn path useful want bundle yarn repository everyone version environment consistency yarn path set via yarn set version command yarn also support yarn set version source command command allows yarn built master another branch reduce wait time important change plugnplay plugnplay alternative installation strategy nodejs typically node package manager generate nodemodules directory node consume via builtin node resolution algorithm node traverse nodemodules directory hierarchy find package manifest file installation resolution strategy following issue nodemodules directory typically contain gargantuan number file time taken generate file make install time even preexisting installation package manager still diff existing nodemodules desired state nodemodules generation ioheavy package manager dont much room improvement optimise installation node resolution algorithm forgiving allowing package arent explicitly declared dependency accessed mean specific version package even availability install guaranteed runtime node resolution algorithm make bunch stat readdir call figure load every single required file process extremely wasteful big contributor node application boot time structure nodemodules directory lend deduping algorithm could employed optimise tree layout via hoisting package manager unable optimise particular pattern minimise disk memory usage yarn hand already know everything know dependency tree instead leaving node locate package plugnplay allows yarn handle resolution yarn plugnplay enabled generates pnpcjs file instead usual nodemodules directory pnpcjs file contains map linking package name version location disk file also contains another map linking package name version dependency approach following benefit cold install single text file generated instead ten thousand reduces installation speed remove disk readwrite speed performance bottleneck installation stable reliable due reduced operation prone failure perfect optimisation dependency tree generated pnpcjs file committed repository support zeroinstalls application startup speed reduced node longer iterate filesystem hierarchy plugnplay zip archive place file nodemodules directory archive file typically size nodemodules offline cache documentation zeroinstalls sideeffect plugnplay local cache introduced yarn consumer configure project achieve zeroinstalls zeroinstalls configured checking local cache yarncache source control see git handle binary file checking generated pnpcjs file source control checking yarnunplugged source control dependency require postinstall script feature allows repository checkedout immediately without first install dependency configuration following benefit improved stability reproducibility build eliminates reliance thirdparty package repository quicker simpler developer experience consistent development environment without install git hook isolates environment issue authentication network connectivity directory write permission etc constraint yarn introduced constraint constraint allow create enforce rule across workspace think linting rule package manifest file constraint recipe example prevent workspace depending specific package prevent workspace depending conflicting version dependency prevent workspace depending nonworkspace version available workspace enforce particular license field across workspace enforce particular enginesnode field across workspace plugins yarn redesigned modular api extended via plugins plugins expose ability add new resolvers add new fetchers add new linkers add new command subscribe event integrate flexible architecture empower opt experimental feature opt default feature perform piecemeal migration leverage community contribution tailor workflow share extension others allows customise enhance package manager behavior functionality design solution according specification without raise rfc reach community consensus wait change release train etc plugins may also shared project patch protocol issue identified dependency yarn patch protocol modify source code without forking dependency crossplatform support yarn run script basic shell script implementation allows operator redirection variable positional argument regardless underlying operating system eliminates tool like crossenv upcoming corepack previously pmm nodejs come npm bundled default user want different package manager installed separately generally issue default docker node image come npm yarn preinstalled proposal pull request put forward including outofthebox support yarn pnpm via corepack nodejs binary manager summit held discus solution incorporating functionality would put popular node package manager equal footing lower barrier alternative package manager multilanguage support one longterm goal yarn become package management platform offering multilanguage support different installation target node yarn architected isolate core resolvers fetchers linkers provided plugins aim offer package management feature languageagnostic way goal realised could help unify tooling within project reference yarn
