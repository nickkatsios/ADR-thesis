system interface architecture must way communicate system virtual machine running otherwise wouldnt possible kind inputoutput thus program perform meaningful work want support different kind system abstraction example operating system commandline virtual machine running system emulation web inputoutput web page support define common interface system component possible architecture mod know main problem certain operation like read concept memory buffer work provide buffer read data stored however dont support concept memory domain cannot anything like implement buffer solution reason traditional read call return data buffer passed reference also return number byte read like int readint char buffer int count however bound interface system implementation freely return complex data object contain actual data read size time data data systemreadfd count size size datagetsize course actual implementation system adapt interface interface real system interacting example real operating system could something like class system readinteger size count data buffer buffer new buffercount int read filesystemreadfd buffer count return new databufferslice read proposed consequence able generic system architecture implementation
