function evaluation simplification background two type axiom function evaluation function definition axiom simplification axiom former taken together cover case function defined expected always match latter useful matched essential however currently differentiating two axiom type example function definition sgnx sgnx sgnx otherwise function simplification mod mod mod mod evaluating function match expression shape thats different resolve everything else equality constraint matching function simplification axiom mod would get mod mod mod result however thats undesirable simplification axiom simplifying normal function may encounter constraint like concatelemxyz mapdomainvalue note constructorlike symbol concat elem unlike constraint mod mod normal function mod also see docsfunctionevaluationmd problemquestions add attribute differentiating definition axiom simplification axiom change function evaluation code work type axiom function definition attribute long term add function simplification attribute since safest way solve problem note may make sense add function definition attribute since principle definition axiom osymbolcount could number simplification axiom however practice would probably undesirable add attribute main semantics especially existing semantics well simplification attribute matching constraint function axiom variable constraint normal function constructor axiom variable easily solvable almost surely come function definition axiom therefore attempt apply axiom generating matching since result probably complex input make sense apply simplification axiom order get something complex matching fail throw error allow matching constraint function without axiom variable variable result constructorlike symbol top constraint seems like function definition one like simplification one allow free pas input made constructorlike stuff allow matching axiom pattern made constructorlike symbol regardless resulting constraint look note actually subcase allow matching constraint function without axiom variable however future may want allow kind matching
