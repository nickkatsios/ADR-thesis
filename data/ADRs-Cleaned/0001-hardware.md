architecture hardware benchmark run benchmark valid orchestrator server apps server tester run shared hardware running everything shared hardware definitely present problem server apps run slower might normal environment due resource contention cpu etc benchmark suite server apps run slower might normal environment due resource contention cpu etc various component server process database process however problem shared equally fhir server benchmarked since one set fhir server apps running time server level playing field true benchmark produce theoretical maximum performance possible fhir server thats really goal anyways positive side running hardware present following advantage exact process running locally running cloud benchmark orchestrator stick docker glue code rather also tread complicated water juggle terraform provisioning etc definitely tradeoff occurring seems reasonable one
