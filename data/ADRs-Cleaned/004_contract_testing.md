contract testing given one api contract document like openapi document several thing one could generate code base contract become way program interacts api create mock server based contract test usually server return response based example found openapi document generate random response contract validate stub test elmspec support cool course something elmspec ever interesting like control exact value response test able tune pertest basis necessary seems give control test writer write test also feeling confident accidentally drifting away api contract implementation decided existing tool validation would nice elm think lot work would necessary happen decided package repo since provides smaller building block compose openapi framework seems work find openapi sure support tool dont seem support validating header response sure couldnt figure pattern case also bring ajv handle validation reponse header necessary seems like could extend pattern continue ajv validator code write provide relevant part openapi doc basically tool think decided allow stub specify contract satisfies make easy describe stub different contract stub validated future would cool one day validation elm seems like would require significant work thought load openapi doc text file yaml json parser elm sure yaml parser implementation fullfeatured enough simplify could parse file side send json value parsed elm side json schema validation elm jsonschema package hasnt worked year say incomplete would code run relevant part contract json schema validation probably getting json schema validation working hardest part
