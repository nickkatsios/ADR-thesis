improving functional test architecture ease support react flow final deciders katrina anderson lauren zugai valerie pomerleau consulted vijay budharam problem statement full rollout react signin route currently scheduled train going staging production however planning full rollout react signin route local execution functional test revealed suite fails consequence route group fully enabled based initial exploration rate failure appears high route group login pom created backbone cover majority signin signup page includes function stateful conditional logic signin prerequisite many functional test setup currently configured backbone flow distinct locator backbone react backbone locator working react viceversa difference flow backbone react going forward cohesive approach adopt order ease rollout react flow maximizing coverage minimizing impact timeline previous react rollouts resetpassword fully rolled production backbone route longer backbone test skipped new reactconversion test running test relatively well isolated migration strategy worked well signup full prod rollout previously attempted rolled back second full prod rollout planned train stage production new react test created signup flow nonsignup test condition added test step either flow based feature flag preparation initial full prod rollout backbone signup test skipped feature flag consequence feature flag currently environment backbone test skipped even though user see backbone version signup flow migration strategy challenge primary strategy supporting react flow functional test mainly create new reactspecific pom page object model duplicate test place reactconversion directory test selected duplication based playwright migration analysis conditionally run react test based feature flag indicating experiment enabled route group additional strategy include conditional logic within test switch react backbone react portion test step based feature flag configuration conditional logic within test run backbone react version flow skip backbone test full prod rollout configuration value checked additional challenge competing idea implemented bridge gap react backbone functional test desired end state react functional test migration universally agreed upon multiple react route different phase rollout mean conditional logic required navigate reactbackbone test step test reactconversion modified cleanup phase remove feature flag check experiment parameter question new pattern would simplify conversion moving forward userfacing locator single page pom route check pom etc plan discontinue backbone test remove skip test specific react conversion route include test step converted route create new test file update pom reactbackbone agnostic handle test setup account creation signup fixture currently backbone pom could modify test architecture support coverage backbone react test route group experiment enabled fully rolled would updating locator backbonereact agnostic resolve majority failure currently unknown without work modify toplevel fixture enroll react experiment instead including forceexperiment params test step driver test coverage chosen ideally maintain increase coverage react flow avoid compromising skipping coverage backbone flow time effort chosen ideally feasable within planned timeframe signin react rollout train best practice technical debt chosen follow guideline outlined playwright ecosystem documentation order compromise overall success rate prevent maintenance cost considered single set pom reactbackbone update existing test

overall best fulfills time effort criterion keeping signin react rollout track action plan outlined served team well thus far separating react backbone concern scale signin case pom test case duplication required would considerably extend timeline releasing react signin feature set maintain amount test coverage however better assures requirement change universally applied test case react backbone offer clarity efficiency ensuring best practice minimizing maintenance cost moving towards ideal pom state lack focus blocker react signin rollout risk causing delay due scope creep implementation guideline page model tied individual page route instead single login pom signinsignup individual pom signin signintokencode confirmsignupcode etc first version approach already created

created difference flow backbone react minimal set react specific test still required experiment active force test react flow pro con single set pom reactbackbone update existing test approach involves phasing pom created backbone login instead pom created react across test new pom userfacing locator generally agnostic reactbackbone pro one set pom maintain individual pom reactbackbone recently created pom current best practice test duplication updating existing test work react backbone might identify bug converted page con test converted far might experiment period cleaned longer needed adding new test might still required flow difference backbone react update page first approach start updating pom perpage basis backbonereact agnostic updating test pro organizes work perpage basis providing clear boundary update focusing updating pom individual page prioritize tackle update granular manner approach allows targeted modification ensuring page functionality properly handled updating pom page page minimizes risk disrupting dependency across different page incremental approach reduces likelihood introducing regression simplifies troubleshooting issue arise update concentrated specific page testing effort focused efficient test change page individually ensuring update meet required criterion moving next page project progress pagefirst approach scale effectively accommodate new page update new page integrated unified pom framework systematically maintaining consistency across test suite con working pagefirst basis mean arent initially targeting failing test react signin rollout might take longer achieve initial goal working backbone pom login combine multiple page signin signup route make difficult see test impacted generic locator selector submmit button requires running whole test suite verify impact change update testfirst approach approach unifying pom involves organizing work pertest basis working group failing test updating corresponding pom needed pro phased updated prioritizing test failing react signin full prod rollout updating remaining test isolate test run verify fix needing run entire suite verify impact modifying locator function con pom updated systematically hoc based test quo migrate test according analysis continuing quo approach mean continuing create new reactspecific test pom react route expectation new test test keep rollout completed backbone pom test would skipped eventually deleted pom shared react backbone approach ensure backbone test always run unless feature flag enabled route groupe fully rolled production pro consistent approach far reset password signup could make cleanup easier backbone route fully decomissioned con test failure backbone page require creating new reactspecific version test adding condition test keep separation old test new test newly created test might short period time requires multiple condition support route group turned onoff issue arise production especially test combine route group react backbone version test different coverage scope requirement definition time due feature development maintenance example name many test changed time precision
