frontend framework background based advice phase team starting largely scratch frontend code project many design element expected carried phase largely rewritten maintainable extensible going forward therefore make technology frontend code overwhelming majority team frontend experience angular however strong indication migrate away angular eventually angular currently represents essentially complete rewrite framework angular released expect angular ecosystem gradually decline size quality library developer shift angular wrote project frontend angular start would almost certainly migrate away angular point lifetime project although whether point would one year five year currently unclear expect migration complex timeconsuming task anything trivial application add significant expected maintenance cost angularbased approach default past two year addition experience angular revealed pain point led many team member express desire try something new given migrating new framework seems inevitable within lifespan project make sense consider alternative angular seem four possible path could take write angular upgrade later default change nothing switch angular new development switch react switch ember implicit rejection exotic approach elm scalajs aurelia immature small ecosystem andor add significant complexity development pipeline time already expect learning kind new framework convergence despite multiplicity frontend web framework story last year among big three web framework angular react ember one convergence three moving toward nextgeneration syntax plus transpilation angular defaulting typescript ember selecting variety approach including clojurescript react similarly angular introduce new angularcli mimic many scaffolding feature available ember embercli angular bring significant improvement page update speed angular adopting approach similar reacts diffing algorithm ember recently rolled new update engine called glimmer take similar approach ember also adopted strong componentbased convention oneway data flow default mimicking react angular also adopt therefore difference framework rapidly becoming availability lack certain builtin feature ecosystem quality maturity project goal governance focus pleasant development experience assessment angular approach would lowest startup cost would able get started right away order make eventual transition angular easy possible would adhere recommended angular style guide course angular development although largely match preferred angular style already recommended way migrate introduce interoperability module project upgrade downgrade angular component talk rewrite component piece piece angular sidebyside continuing support situation angular release angular currently unclear google provided assurance cease development angular vast majority user switched angular unclear happen definition vast majority want left member angular xusing minority google stop development angular way avoid problem migrating angular later life project begin angular immediately even state would gain benefit angular right start would allow learn framework project still small would also give firstclass usage typescript something framework list lack primary downside angular still young project expected bug usability documentation issue lack library community literature near future there also unlikely real possibility framework suffers unknown design flaw wont exposed received realworld usage given angulars popularity backing google assume issue ironed eventually place cost development least next year two react react ecosystem mature team azavea one key difference react angular ember react fullfeatured framework library generating component communicate module flux redux required least almost universally build full frontend architecture modular architecture run somewhat counter team framework preference historically preferred fullfeatured opinionated framework assembling collection component experience reducing number component application stack usually improves reliability eliminates development headache said opinionated framework sometimes get way try something unusual experience long rare occurrence price worth paying structural issue aside react healthy ecosystem numerous library team azavea would able leverage knowledge run issue ember ember fullfeatured opinionated mvc web framework quite mature term feature indeed mentioned angular angularcli heavily inspired ember embercli similar angular ember working incorporate reactinspired feature including oneway dataflows default faster differential page update engine however contrast angular ember already completed rolled update ember released year ago addition ember largely maintaining backwards compatibility rather rewriting entire framework current release embercli offer impressive scaffolding capability provides scaffolding common application component including route test default project come testing environment already set working embercli also includes package manager adding community module one project ember big step lack type safety possible typescript angular plugin typescript ember would likely imperfect ember well known react angular result smaller ecosystem literature library however niche framework mean stackoverflow question tagged emberjs compared reactjs angular however question tagged angularjs project carry large number complex technical issue new technology related raster processing initial stage project productive learn new frontend framework alongside development complex backend architecture weighs favor sticking know start however longterm support situation angular currently unclear seems least partially tied community usage angular tough predict additionally angular ember potentially exotic framework elm appear offer significant benefit angular improved page rendering speed better developer ergonomics raster foundry initially angular following style recommended upgrade guide additionally invest longterm productivity hedge decay angular ecosystem devoting resource toward incremental upgrade process starting around beginning second quarter development work roughly midnovember process expected initially consume persprint development point although exact first step incremental upgrade process decided possibility might include introduce typescript transpilation layer existing project begin rewriting existing code one two language identify existing functionality well compartmentalized rewrite another framework framework ass ergonomics interoperability identify planned component would benefit strength different framework write framework consequence developer thoroughly read familiarize angular upgrade guide track development angular ecosystem work strike balance investment new feature migrating away angular avoid accruing technical debt likely develop temporary system development angular alongside angular another framework within frontend application
