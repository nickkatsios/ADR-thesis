kind architecture record adr adding stylelint mathieu degand since beginning component library weve never dedicated tool format enforce rule custom eslint plugin sort declaration pretty much referenced adr however found stylelint able handle template literal thus decided give try reworking adapting tool component library considered solution first thing consider config would config would allow enforce style rule standardize code formatting purpose test relying base configs first recommended standard checked airbnb one finally tried create config config recommended recommended premade configuration available default stylelint may choose create config main purpose avoid common code error wont anything else mean wont enforce convention format specific rule could served base configuration decided doesnt provide base code format base rule standard standard configuration provided stylelint present default must install add dependency based recommended improves enforcing convention formatting standard recommended lack rule formatting decided default instead chose custom configuration based standard allows override rule thought didnt match code style airbnb trying one provided stylelint decided check available web see popular one saw one airbnb quite popular however checking found latest version stylelint indeed would take much effort make work new version also downgrading stylelint something wanted make decided choose custom finally tried create custom config solution chosen detailed solution section order alphabetical name suggests first considered ordering property alphabetically good idea wanted logical order isnt complex didnt choose solution idiomatic order property one related positioning display box model rule rule ordered alphabetically find info idiomatic repository documentation solution discussion team decided take standard configuration base rule code format tweak purpose tool named stylelint config generator composed rule rule let choose several alternative would suit best added idiomatic order configuration property order resulted config file json extends stylelintconfigstandard stylelintconfigidiomaticorder plugins

configuration deeper find description rule stylelint website done adding overriding existing rule standard configuration best match run check style component created three command packagejson stylelint run stylelint check error stylelintfix run stylelint check error autofixes one auto fixable stylelintci run stylelint check error format output github action benefit stylelint coherent style across component library code base formatting everywhere also allowed get rid custom eslint sort plugin done stylelint directly problem encountered satisfied current configuration encountered problem process rule whitespace rule first problem whitespace rule noeolwhitespacerule purpose rule whitespace line ending semicolon empty line problem processor target inside template literal mean backtick wasnt included lead code going javascript static get style return skeletonstyles languagecss host display block javascript static get style return skeletonstyles languagecss host display block see closing backtick template literal isnt formatted correctly due rule taking account whats inside backticks therefore rule considers space closing backtick shouldnt remove correct formatting led deactivate rule selector name case encountered another problem case policy applied selector indeed standard configuration want selector written kebabcase however component also kebabcase snakecase resolve problem decided override rule selectorclasspattern selectoridpattern match led following rule json selectorclasspattern azazaz message expected class selector either kebabcase kebabcase snakecase selectoridpattern azazaz message expected selector either kebabcase kebabcase snakecase make work modified regular expression directly provided stylelint website match also provided custom message know precisely whats happening otherwise would generic message duplicate selector atom component wrap customises native html element multiple selector native element ccbutton wrap customises native button always reset one reset native style element another one style problem allowed noduplicateselectors rule part custom config like way reset default apply style also like rule decided ignore rule specific selector nodescendingspecificity nodescendingspecificity rule force order selector within specificity mean selector lower specificity one higher specificity great rule decided indeed blank project might much convenient case tricky mess deal component deactivated find info specificity mdn mdn specificity trick trick specificity whats next happy configuration right future
