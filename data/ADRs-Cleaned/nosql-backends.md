adr supporting nosql backends jean cochrane open source fellow summer grout currently tightly coupled postgresql dependency postgres powerful database engine also difficult deploy potentially serious barrier adoption grout make grout even easier would like support nosql backends however nosql backend feasible must provide support key grout function storing geospatial data querying geospatial data querying complex json data including nested search find value baz infoo bar baz compound rule foo bar baz optional jsonschema support addition nosql backends considered based much value bring project including easy backend configure deploy cheap free document look different nosql backends including mongodb couchdb google cloud firestore aws dynamodb jsonbin eliminating cannot support basic requirement grout evaluate cloud provider finally consider value nosql backend would bring project backends mongodb mongodb opensource nonrelational database store data jsonlike format translates json object document organized collection here score requirement geospatial data mongodb store arbitrary geojson meaning point polygon supported geospatial query mongodb support geospatial querying intersection within near query query make geojson object comparison operation querying json run query nested field support condition support logical condition jsonschema support mongodb support jsonschema validating create update operation draft supported limitation documentation doesnt describe limitation however couchdb couchdb opensource nonrelational database similar mongodb focus supporting highlydistributed database data stored jsonlike document database queryable rest api geospatial support provided official plugin geocouch documentation great distributed github new tagged release since geospatial query geocouch save point return bounding box request querying json query capability powerful quite esoteric thirdparty javascript api pouchdb available jsonschema support external reference possible define validation function create update operation could hack together schema solution nothing come box google cloud firestore google cloud firestore proprietary nonrelational database service provided google data model similar mongodb object stored document inside collection currently beta geospatial support firestore type latlng coordinate presumably theyre stored webmercator there much information firestore support polygon querying geospatial data seems possible cant find documentation blog post issue querying json firestore serious limitation cannot query across multiple collection cannot support range filter multiple field cannot support logical query reccommends performing multiple query merging clientside may work case jsonschema support result search define validation pattern security rule firestores idiomatic security rule syntax aws dynamodb dynamodb proprietary nonrelational database provided service amazon web service support keyvalue documentbased data storage object stored item row queried primary key designed easily integrate aws product geospatial support dynamodb support geohashes point geometry support polygon geospatial query relies thirdparty java library sparsely documented allows searching coordinate within radius box querying json limitation query search item attached primary key query retrieve maximum data raise question image true aws form query doc slog decipher result confident fully understand capability jsonschema support schema validation whatsoever jsonbin jsonbin jsonstoreasaservice allows developer easily store retrieve json data rest api sense like serverless json datastore requires configuration builtin permission token authentication system main focus simplicity easeofuse geospatial support since jsonbin store document pure json geojson inherently supported geospatial query querying product roadmap currently supported querying json querying product roadmap currently supported jsonschema support mention validation api documentation provider based research summarized mongodb backend considered support project requirement considered cloud provider mongodb two main cloud provider mongodb mongodb atlas hosting service provided mongodb mlab thirdparty service mlab read argument favor mlab see mlabs account better mongodb atlas pro free nonexpiring sandbox account storage shared hosting variable ram integrates aws quick easy set con provided thirdparty lag behind current release mongodb however available sandbox account july mongodb atlas read argument favor mongodb atlas see mongodb atlas account better mlab pro provided mongodb team integrates aws slightly complicated set still easy relative hosting database integrates mongodb stitch serverless backendasaservice mongodb application con free tier come major limitation idle instance may terminated backup max throughput writessec data transfer limit gbweek value two main goal supporting nosql backend include making grout easier configure deploy abstracting data model could applied backends future ill look goal detail making grout easier configure deploy pro mongodb slightly easier configure postgres however still requires configuration developer con database server still must deployed interact database mean developer must still deploy database database server addition frontend mongodb offer serverless framework mongodb stitch expose api queried client side serverless pattern like would substantial improvement existing development framework moving direction would require grout nosql backend tightly coupled certain provider mongodb stitch would introduce another layer integration would slow development process overall score mediumlow abstracting data model pro mongodb would let represent data model jsonschema validate backend would big win generalizability con jsonschema widely supported among nosql provider according research overall score medium based research recommend move forward nosql backend build top mongodb promising work done many nonrelational database mongodb currently nosql database satisfies project requirement mongodb satisifes project requirement however still uncertain whether value proposition strong enough prioritize work seems mongodb present strong value proposition backend component eliminated completely infrastructure provisioning otherwise deploying nosql database requires essentially amount work mongodb technically possible atlas stitch serverless stack however choosing stack require integrating two separate service making work much complex introducing undesirable coupling application review
