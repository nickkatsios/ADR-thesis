kind architecture record adr give feedback user action pierre soyres adr try explain implemented mechanism trigger notification user action user performs action clicking button common practice give feedback action completed something wrong showing error message may help user understand happened maybe provide insight correct error also showing message action succeeded comfort user action taken account successfully started simply displaying error message near button triggered action problem error message hard place nicely consistency component maintain different error state complicates code lot handle case action succeeded want explaining solution want want message located area screen want message appear without disturbing user workflow want message disappear automatically small amount time second want message decorated way intention easily understood information success warning error toast pattern seems technically speaking want allow developer integrate component totally decoupled manner doesnt adherence technology framework case lit finally try pragmatic provide many feature dont right implemented created system composed two web component cctoast component display message cctoaster component container cctoast element work cctoaster show cctoast going see certain amount time cctoast component dispatch cctoastdismiss event event also dispatched user click close button cctoaster listens cctoastdismiss event reacts hiding corresponding cctoast hard part provide nice flexible way interact cctoaster made one want share path leaded final implementation section show implementation cctoaster implementation give example note example assumes cctoaster element somewhere dom first implementation first implementation based two public method cctoaster component code looked like javascript class cctoaster showtoast const key abcdef forged unique identifier toast display logic return key dismisskey toast dismiss logic code show javascript showing toast done public show method const toastkey documentqueryselectorcctoastershow message something went wrong perfoming action intent danger dismissing toast done unique identifier returned show method documentqueryselectorcctoasterdismisstoastkey problem technique internal toast identifier key leaking component internal implementation detail developer write code glue cctoaster application point wanted developer write code possible integration second implementation second attempt remove public method base implementation custom event cctoaster element added dom start listening cctoastshow event windowaddeventlistener code looked like javascript class cctoaster connectedcallback windowaddeventlistenercctoastshow event toast display logic eventdismisstoast dismiss toast logic

attached event work event handled synchronously eventdismisstoast technique come problem integration becomes minimalist fact found much magic going underneath developer control dom element event listen even recommended prevents developer multiple cctoaster application final implementation needed rework implementation solution came code look like javascript class cctoaster showtoast toast display logic return toast dismiss logic code show javascript showing toast done theshow public method const dismisstoast documentqueryselectorcctoastershow message something went wrong perfoming action intent danger dismissing toast done function returned show method dismisstoast final implementation take best previous attempt removed magic happening cctoaster element added dom result developer code glue application toaster kept ability programmatically dismiss toast without maintain unique identifier toast wrapping first wanted integration toaster done code possible figured introduced bit much magic came back something requires bit glue fact provides greater flexibility developer believe integration done decoupling mind nice way dom event code show integrate cctoaster clever console javascript const toaster documentqueryselectorcctoaster listen component app want display notification clever component already send ccnotify event windowaddeventlistenerccnotify detail

managed achieve system allows two important thing developer notificationtoast system tech stack legacy jquery vuejs react even project doesnt clever component developer clever component send ccnotify event without notificationtoast system something else may already project reference comparing implementation library always interesting check difference libs took two different toaster httpsfkhadragithubioreacttoastify one work react lot feature dont httpsgithubcommaronatovuetoastification one work vuejs neither dont accessibility arialabel close button hard coded english
