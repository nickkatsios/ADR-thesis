solution facilitates coherent set business function implement ddd defines ubiquitous language implemented solution implemented one gcp project lot different function required support business function grouped coherent set referred solution functionality defined set function implemented platform fulfilling business requirement solution also implement domain crossing functionality service provided one domain consumed another domain define solution implementation coherent set business function platform consequence advantage grouping function solution make implementation management easier solution scope implementation allowing modular design disadvantage many different solution scope defined group function domain actual defined scope impact changability flexibility resulting implementation therefore scoping solution difficult cannot done without vision strategy
