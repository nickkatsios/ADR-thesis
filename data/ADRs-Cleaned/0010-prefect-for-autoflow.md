prefect workflow definition execution autoflow november pending first prototype autoflow apache airflow flowetl define execute workflow however proved problematic respect airflow limited support parametrising dag run sharing data task rerunning dag execution already run complicated prefect core opensource workflow engine allows dag parametrised run simultaneously multiple set parameter allows data exchange task prefect also allows creation dynamicallygenerated task mapped output running another task make easier autoflow spawn multiple run workflow sensor find multiple day data workflow previously run autoflow prefect define run workflow consequence process parametrising dynamically mapping workflow run simpler would airflow unlike airflow prefect core full workflow management system provides functionality defining workflow running individually full workflow orchestration monitoring system left proprietary prefect cloud platform result autoflow cannot benefit airflow provides future want autoflow run multiple sensor workflow write code concurrently
