clean architecture deciders nathan fiedler application inevitably form design applied whether ugly bag mostly function disciplined model developed group software design expert good design dramatic effect quality application enabling developer quickly become familiar existing code knowing new functionality would fit big picture one simple yet effective design called clean architecture described robert martin blog post see reference application divided several layer dependency layer going one direction encourages loose coupling enables thorough unit testing isolation unit via mocking clean architecture build earlier model including hexagonal architecture onion architecture similarly break application layer dependency flowing one direction tutorial matt reet dart flutter version clean architecture domain layer defines interface one repository whose implementation life data layer separation often covered depiction clean architecture helpful understanding best keep dependency unidirectional well encouraging loose coupling easier testing version clean architecture described matt reet additionally dependency injection aka inversion control maintain clean separation layer permit easy unit testing consequence design application several month proven helpful testing easier knowing find code easier knowing fit new code straightforward starting case working code practically design discourages writing unnecessary thing link clean architecture cleancodercom
