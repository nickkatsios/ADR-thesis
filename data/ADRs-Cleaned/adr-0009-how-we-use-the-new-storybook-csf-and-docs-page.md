kind architecture record adr new storybook csf doc page hubert sablonnire web component project started march setup storybook day one storybookhtml usage like chose storybookhtml setup storybookpolymer one really suited litelement usage since html dom storybookhtml felt created story component storiesof pure html story lot raw dom story helper way story created completely agnostic helper lib litelement often grouped several case one story could see different permutationsexamples one page time gave opportunity add title info html content story separate document case transformed welcome doc readme changelog guide markdown html add story could display final site webcomponentanalyzer build markdown doc component integrated addon note latest version wca really cover attrs prop event slot custom prop method could easily describe prop event type typescript snippet detail created set story different width easily test component react responsive situation meant sometimes foobar story foobar story foobar story addon knob lot since tend cover different variant story also found knob usage htmldom story bit cumbersome since often mean full reload story goal main goal upgrade latest storybook investigate try migrate storybookhtml storybookwebcomponents migrate storiesof csf migrate addon note addon doc doc page mdx file went storybookhtml storybookwebcomponents moved storybookhtml storybookwebcomponents allowed return lithtml story end dont really anyway note remove error already defined custom element hmr setup still manual story authoring format declare story raw dom sometimes html raw dom allowed reuse logic write fewer code mostly example data tried move lithtml based story verbose initial helper createcomponent allow easily reuse bit template since juggle real lithtml templated string decided create new helper makestory write code possible story pushed concentrate writing given story around one component focusing want try reuse code example data easily here example show cctileinstances time different data instance property custom const conf component cctileinstances csscctileinstances display inlinegrid marginbottom rem marginright rem width export const defaultstory makestoryconf item instance running flavorname nano count deploying instance running deploying flavorname nano count instance running flavorname nano count deploying flavorname nano count moving csf new csf really nice fact abouts migration usage story reuse since story export improved ccoverview story including real example child component instead skeleton state story story name way story name computed exported function name taste way override name also taste makestory helper allows specify name cleaner way enhancestoriesnames helper allows function name rely convention transformdecorate name organization navigation tree modify story envvareditor storiesof twice file different subpath left navigation tree possible csf tried two file decided keep one rework story hierarchy moving addon doc lot reading addon doc work doc page generated csf file generated mdx file mix boths different way mdx file dont react background small team jsx inside markdown show html put inside lithtml tagged template felt weird say least also trivial debug somethings wrong mdx file dont know jsx work example case seems suited author lithtml story explained makestory helper allows write code describe component given situation mdx file seems suited prose heavy documentation page sometimes block paragraph live story prop doc case mostly live story doc around text documentation page markdown boilerplate code integrate story took opportunity rename file storiesmdx add title meta listed story properly inside doc tab note dont really like file mdx rather pure markdown file let webpack loader load title parsed markdown meta title doc page csf doc page generated csf file really close spirit want display component name description text doc extracted jsdoc interface doc aka prop table extracted jsdoc story live demo show code ability annotate story additional doc single page story doc tab decided split story showcasing several different situation one multiple small story remove multiple width story addon viewport reuse story inside others see ccoverview wishlist grateful many new feature storybook community gave tool new addon doc truly awesome component library excited point wishing even list work proposition issue maybe code next weeksmonths note able patch stuff time wed love stableofficial solution doc page show code example expect jsx always dark mode dirty patched storybookcomponentsdistblockspreviewjs order force html able set light theme syntax coloration still weird content html tag readable show code example show two much often whole story code setup stuff seems like location mechanism display whats necessary able make work able generate simple html story provide show code content storyfnstoryparametersmdxsource makestory helper beginning imagine tabbed interface datacsshtml html could several tab one usage framework wanted official way add markdown descriptiondocumentation given story able provide story description storyfnstoryparametersdocsstorydescription makestory helper prop table still feel like created react pro attrs arent merged would love something like apiviewerelement instead tried patch doc page wasnt easy hacky prop table lack method type thats still note addon included customelementjson yet guess make sense sometimes dont want display first story prop table could change knob doc page could addon viewport switch doc page regarging prop table think would make sense add thing list key component maybe different translation text list dependency link size whole deps tree shaking external npm deps internal file reused style image display size normal min gzipped small installsetup snippet link source component story future find way improve dont like much implement wish would able ditch note addon publish storybook doc
