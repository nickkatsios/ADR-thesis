routing feedback design proposed deciders dominik karl konrad paul problem statement pfs receives information payment network different source topology information chain capacity information node node presence matrix currently doesnt receive feedback whether proposed route worked initiator payment three goal feedback mechanism failure detection quality service pfs routing improvement driver privacy node behavior cheating node usable feedback pfs considered solution participant sends proof probably balance proof transfer pfs solution initiator includes nonworking route subsequent request pfs solution initiator sends feedback nonsuccessful route pfs acceptance feedback bound lifetime token received requesting route outcome chosen allows node disable route feedback greater privacy also provides feedback working route comparison positive consequence pfs receives positive negative feedback route proposes feedback bound token received requesting route misusage financial disadvantage negative consequence feedback node provide verified shouldnt trusted node explicitly exclude certain route requesting route pfs
