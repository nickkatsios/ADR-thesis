managing log every application manage log different level sending different channel want normal approach regarding managing log according logging concern confined adapter layer leaving application layer independent however since content logged also produced application layer way communicate logger usual solution add message bus case service information relevant communicated outside world application logic point view sent message adapter able catch message maybe send logger example log way display debug stack trace fact already place mechanism display error end user specific case however case stated focused communicate end user reason content display user friendly mean application error specific message informing user example input validation error system error likely generic message without technical detail wouldnt interesting end user kind error wont contain stack trace displayed end user thus cannot error displayed user interface debug mechanism left debugging log particular error handler application interactor send complete error object message addition displaying generic error message error message caught logger handler decide writing stack trace according current application runtime mode environment debug mode different build environment application application written compiled language usually built debug mode since activating debug mean adding lot code slows everything application written interpreter language really possible still want maintain semantic debug mode configuration environment choice like command line argument userprovided selection anyway select debug mode enabled according execution environment example dev test application mode usually debug enabled production mode decide multiple thing debug mode starter decide want show stack trace instead simple error message log message even non error one acceptance test dont want display log main output example stderr acceptance test test application work end user wont see debug log time want debug information available well writing debug log file instead console dev mode instead running application manually well redirect error log console well direct debugging show stack trace debug mode application debug mode avoid writing stack trace application log still contain information error theyre meant informative end user well think example input error however system error debug mode generic user friendly message containing useful information understanding whats error reason write stack trace system error also debug mode course displaying end user proposed consequence application layer stay independent logging concern sends meaningful application message adapter even case reason example logging stack trace displayed main error output error log development mode redirected standard error turn handy main error output display user friendly message
