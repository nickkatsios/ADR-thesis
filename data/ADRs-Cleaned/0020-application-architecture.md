documented application architecture new backend service deciders ben bangert ryan kelly vijay budhram jody heavener danny coates dave justice problem statement fxa backend service stack contains application architecture adhoc documented missing modern feature dependency injection result following problem new developer struggle get speed must learn architecture reading code documentation application structure theyre structured way new component added fit backend service may vary adhoc architecture well adding new object needed route handler timeconsuming object must plumbed entire initialization chain elegant method like dependency injection clear wherehow add new component take time studyunderstand thing currently setup attempt mimic structure new component time consuming setup boilerplate component tooling work current adhoc application architecture adhoc architecture frequently mix concern business logic mixed request handling logic wart evolution time planned front
