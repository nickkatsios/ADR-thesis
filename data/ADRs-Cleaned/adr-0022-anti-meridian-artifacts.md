antimeridian artifact observation polygon cross antimeridian ambiguous various heuristic determine best display none correct case fixing polygon multiple solution theyre relatively easy implement determining polygon fixed straightforward question possible solution none address every possible case since mathematically ambiguous problem heuristic make compromise somewhere smallest area calculate area polygon two way one polygon cross antimeridian wrap around direction assume smaller one correct advantage relatively simple implement likely correct imagery disadvantage polygon cover half world horizontally shown wrapping around world wrong direction imagery handle cover wide area imagery provider tend chop imagery easier processing degree difference threshold calculation abswestmost coord eastmost coord degree threshold advantage affect polygon close meridian disadvantage doesnt fix polygon outside threshold false positive small polygon close antimeridian threshold must tuned expected size polygon cant deal large small polygon equally well assume polygon cross antimeridian advantage easy assume polygon source split multipolygons instead crossing antimeridian disadvantage doesnt actually address problem since cant choose polygon coming combine smallest area degree difference threshold also apply thumbnail advantage somewhat better solution individually avoids issue small polygon near antimeridian disadvantage still issue large polygon eastmost westmost point must relatively near antimeridian proposal hybrid smallest area degree difference approach apply scene footprint dont currently support imagery source cover wide swath globe good enough temporary solution
