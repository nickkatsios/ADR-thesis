mongodb datetime representation representing rfc mongodb cloudevent jackson sdk allow query problematic mongodb internally represents millisecond resolution see internally object stored signed bit integer representing number millisecond since unix epoch jan since java cloudevent sdk offsetdatetime well lose nanosecond precision timezone converting offsetdatetime really bad since understandability transparent goal occurrent create cloudevent offsetdatetime containing nanosecond timezone europestockholm would expect get value back read possible convert weve thus decided store zonedatetime rfc string mongodb mean range query time horrendously slow probably work expected string comparision instead comparision eventstorequeries api currently support sorting event natural order ascendingdescending much faster since timestamp generated mongodb object note sort timeasc timedesc still retained api reason may allow customizations serialization mechanism nanosecond resolution required timezone always utc future alternative alternative worth considering would add additional field serialization process example retain time rfc string add additional field mongodb store fast time query ive decided though following reason code simplicity would needed handle time query specially example probably would like compare time field want compare field combination gte becomes even problematic time query fast index would needed would introduce additional complexity user mongodb eventstore index would created fast query creating index automatically would good idea since might required every user user may never query time case storing extra field simply unnecessary reason weve decided better user simply add custom extension field himherself create custom query field eventstorequeries api event support querying custom field right though could expand api allow custom sortby field instead hardcoding time natural consequence quite sad since still common represent time java application case would perfectly fine native isodate mongodb converting offsetdatetime would possible get best world store mongodb one nice benefit cloudevents lost
