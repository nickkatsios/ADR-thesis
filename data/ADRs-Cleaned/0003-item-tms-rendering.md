itemtmsrendering title item rendering make franklin useful tool people working machine learning project able serve json metadata imagery label also imagery label asset adr focus two question particular domain serving imagery render render user discover something renderable render stac api many item may may cog challenge deciding make endpoint available different level user interaction could render item case user dont get choose collection since collection could render item collection item catalog case transaction endpoint implemented would user create container put item inside could render arbitrary search result case user would describe sort item want see would provide way visualize itemcollection response wouldnt anything persistent collection item though would something least semipersistent visualization collection item rendering collection hard technical problem however rendering collection also expose risk people returning item different sort imagery shortterm viewing image label risk doesnt come much benefit attached reason render single item render single item goal support rendering solves problem data accessed doesnt solve problem render imagery rendering label since working rendering paint raster label least three possibility state raster label three band one band surprising number band raster label three band dont help user make decent effort coloring assume band rgb produce png ship back walk away raster label one band situation ambiguous case probable label categorical take first stab coloring image labelitems labelclasses property determine distinct class choose random color render image color map strategy expose new problem dont anywhere currently persist color map either color map choose query parameter somehow well associate item database detail problem section persisting style case strategy available coloring singleband label well raster label number band obvious instinct refuse render dont think guess stage someone would produce label want come listen see incorporate rendering imagery several attempt made standardize interface describing render imagery raster foundry described bunch imagery adjustment custom type color ramp color palette last summer someone proposed extension stac specification include visualization parameter based google earth engine experience ogc description style styled layer descriptor slds past particular district builder project getting speed slds wasnt easy getting essential color polygon challenge wanted however think slds right move reason first district builder slds hand edited gigantic config xml file made easy construct incomplete invalid object since franklin written scala capitalize scalaxb automatically generate type necessary write slds hand pull request geotrellisserver add relevant xml schema verify type exist publishing opengis submodule locally importing opengissld ammonite repl second slds allow describe rendering strategy vector raster data adr address rendering raster data render vector data future come another rendering strategy helpful third dialog stac ogc direction geospatial web service take make likely wed justify sld chose something else probably better writing forcing champion usage standard persisting style since user probably dont want specify visualization parameter every time look layer well want persist slds item somewhere right franklin backed postgresql database backends possible well one store style information separate table storing style separate table would open possibility conforming ogc style api specification ogc style api prescribes set endpoint creating managing style either sld mapbox style adding endpoint style management would make api interaction slightly easier user would able color style raster later vector layer qgis export sld post api request would add asset stac item would require patching additional asset instead full sld document two store sld document property item separate column downside inserting sld directly item property since sld xml well mixing json xml json people generally expect conform specification property stac item freeform preference avoiding nesting throwing potentially nested raw xml string property sound like great idea however could provide json codec type generated sld schema downside throwing separate column extent break model foreign key json document entire record postgres expanding column represent entity conjunction entity json document make postgres like backends might pursue question whether attempt develop line ogc api style specification win get attempting conform style specification dont limb design style management justify choice make people think weird since previous section already say sld describing render attempting conform ogc style api specification natural choice user discover there tile layer available item one question whether tile url link asset since link link object resource related url asset asset object downloaded tile layer url link asset isnt currently iana relation type tile however map tile api specification include link rel tile map tile specification still work progress least sign direction ogc going thinking advertise tile collection planning serve tile item rather collection still reasonable source inspiration pursuit shortterm goal get rendering machinery place render item styling slds since provide many styling compatible open source geospatial tool standard style persisted separate table style management occur endpoint described ogc api style specification user know view layer item link relation type tile consequence result adr well familiarize sld open issue appropriate repository rendering entity tmsreification hasrasterextents latter histogram add
