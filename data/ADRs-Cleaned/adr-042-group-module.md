adr group module changelog initial draft draft abstract adr defines xgroup module allows creation management onchain multisignature account enables voting message execution based configurable policy legacy amino multisignature mechanism cosmos sdk certain limitation key rotation possible although solved account rekeying threshold cant changed cumbersome nontechnical user requires legacyamino sign mode group module meant total replacement current multisignature account provides solution limitation described flexible key management system key added updated removed well configurable threshold meant access control module xfeegrant xauthz simplify key management individual organization propose merging xgroup module supporting ormtable store package cosmos sdk continuing development dedicated
