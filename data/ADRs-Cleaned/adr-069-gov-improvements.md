adr xgov modularity multiple choice optimistic proposal changelog initial draft julienrbrt tacturtle abstract governance important aspect cosmos sdk chain adr aimed extend xgov module functionality adding two different kind proposal well making xgov composable extendable two type namely multiple choice proposal optimistic proposal xgov center cosmos governance already improved first version vbeta second version second iteration gov unlocked many possibility letting governance proposal contain number proposal last addition gov expedited proposal proposal shorter voting period higher quorum approval threshold community requested two additional proposal improving governance choice proposal would useful protocol made specific choice simplifying regular proposal require high community involvement additionally sdk allow chain customize tallying method proposal want count vote another way currently cosmos sdk count vote proportionally voting powerstake however custom tallying could allow counting vote quadratic function instead xgov integrate function extract helper interface extending xgov module capability proposal currently proposal vproposal optimistic
