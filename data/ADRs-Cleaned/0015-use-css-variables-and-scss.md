variable prefer cssinjs deciders lauren zugai jody heavener problem statement setting redesign project offer ideal opportunity review convention architecture fxa building new component project also fxa moving forward part adr concern variable come play variable cssinjs consideration module note variable technically called custom property referred common variable nomenclature throughout adr sas preprocessor preferred syntax sas explained driver simplicity clarity dry reusable style easy integration current engineering experience preference considered styling variable sas variable variable combination sas variable styling placement cssinjs helper lib like styledcomponents reactjss module outcome chosen variable variable sas prevent mixins sas function like darken rely variable value without impeding core functionality fxa sas like nested selector extends function mixins dont rely variable value like generation medium query variable native browser prudent one good browser support without preprocessor changed preprocessor compilation targetable javascript easily themed scoped globally element providing usage scoped component solution cssinjs module encourage selfcontained component rather building whole one goal fxa reuse component across ecosystem possible fxareact package fxa likely reap benefit classbased approach allows globally shared style loosely coupled stylesheet rather tightly coupled cssinjs solution conditional style based prop component class promote dryer consistent approach cssinjs would add one additional layer tech learn like styledcomponents syntax best practice setting redesign project already introducing novel tech member fxa engineering team also whole personally prefer cssinjs doesnt preclude implementing module later time determined would prefer component scoped style variable could still later switch cssinjs pro con styling variable sas variable sas variable refer value set name fontsize sas file referenced declaration also utilize many sass powerful feature compiled runtime exist compiled output pro sas variable around time established best organizational practice sas variable would allow usage advanced sas function like calculation function like darken directive like somevariable neutral sas variable imperative hold one value time variable change value earlier reference remain wed add rescript webpack custom config expose global sas variable file con sas variable offer limited set precompilation power variable cant set dynamically stylesheet loaded variable custom property variable provide powerful native browser solution setting property variable declared fontcolor grey color varfontcolor present outputted sas compilation pro still many sas feature variable still able nest selector mixins dont require calculation based variable value responsive design mixins like include minwidthtablet mixins purpose shared style drying code choosing variable help future proof fxas frontend stack sas allows function execution sas variable line able function color modifier native variable variable easy target javascript necessary unlock new possibility chosen prefer file see second made adr open possibility updating variable value case arises variable ideal theming make future dark mode feature requested straightforward would simply change set variable either preferscolorscheme medium query checking flag set localstorage variable global scoped elementselector example variable value change per class without set property hcolor grey color varhcolor special hcolor black neutral variable meet minimum browser compatibility list fxa great support otherwise arent supported variable seen developer tool many scoped root globally component question look like lot cruft also convenient depending inspected con since sas function mixins etc ran runtime variable dynamic sas functionality incompatible however fxa currently sas function like darken transition relatively painless still native calc property variable fairly new best practice pattern still established opinion formed based work fxaadminpanel small project outside work mozilla well make architectural part adrs based experience believe pave best way forward fxa small win bento menu monitor site implementing setting redesign project variable combination sas variable static value color fontsizes could declared sas variable value could set variable pro variable type would allow calculation mixins needed static value would clear variable never change implemented correctly maintained could take best world variable advanced sas functionality con approach unconventional likely confusing current new team member plus open source contributor without reading fxa stack documentation engineer may unknowingly set variable sas variable variable vice versa mixins certain variable lead additional debugging someone acquainted desire simplicity clarity styling placement cssinjs helper lib like styledcomponents reactjss cssinjs solution blend javascript scope style component typically live file component declaration depending library syntax resemble actually look quite different pro cssinjs would allow take advantage statebased styling without conditional class name instead would set conditional style would allow easy deletion maintenance style component deleted moved related style engineer could modify component confidence component wouldnt affected could still variable many cssinjs library integrate well react styledcomponents quickly growing popularity since style scoped per component generated class name wont clash unique specificitywise short efficient engineer would come name class neutral introduces separation concern style component plus jslike syntax pro con depending individual preference con since style scoped per component lead copypasta shared style consistency component would unable sas feature like mixins causing reevaluate wed set medium query potentially heavily relied aspect current implementation library add one dependency layer stack well one piece technology current future team member would learn one hurdle open source contributor especially since fix common contribution would adjust new nesting syntax convention sharing style component straightforward styledcomponents reactjss still complex adding class name reference shared style least several team member expressed dislike cssinjs various reason minor inconvenience would setup yet another linting file rootlevel stylelint module module could help bridge gap external stylesheet cssinjs allow external stylesheet scoping style component pro sas variable viewed sas scoped class could still get benefit setting class shared style benefitting scoped component generated class name prevent name clash relieve manually name class con typical would scope style component component would inherit potential copypasta shared style consistency component problem cssinjs chose class shared style scope unique component style simplicity clarity could muddled separation concern greater cssinjs requires setting style react component inline jsx combination shared class scoped inline style could make debugging issue slightly complex similar cssinjs lesser scale would introduce yet another new frontend concept engineer learn understand sas preposessor convert external sas file variable nesting mixins inheritence convenience pure syntax flavor sas preferred many pro team already familiar like expressed preference external style cssinjs still popular choice organization included dependency createreactapp default encourages building whole shared style instead component encapsulation could con large project many shared component fxa lot global shared style class name based approach result dryer code offer handy functionality still variable like nesting mixins con clear solution style applied per component without potentially checking multiple file requires naming convention standard class name organization ensure easy maintenance link setting redesign epic adr part issue adr part issue styledcomponents reactjss sas sas variable sas custom propertiesvariables
