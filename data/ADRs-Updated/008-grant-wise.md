# Extracting Grant Wise Expenditure

* Status: [accepted]

## Context and Problem Statement

While extracting the `Grant-wise expenditure` a lot of site crashes were encountered. A decision was taken earlier to extract the `DDO-wise expenditure` section from Koshvani as both section contain the same information in different heirarchies.

## Decision Drivers

The challenges around site crashes have been addressed and the `Grant-wise expenditure` section can now be extracted.

## Decision Outcome

The `Grant-wise expenditure` section is being extracted over the `DDO-wise expenditure` section.
