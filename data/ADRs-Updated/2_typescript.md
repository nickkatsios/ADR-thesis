# Design decision 2 - Use typescript

## Background

Need to decide whether or not to use type-checking.

## Findings

Typescript provides the advantages of:

- Built-in documentation
- Type checking
- Improved maintainability

For our project, using typescript with styled-component themes will have the advantage of enforcing a theme structure. Also, since we are planning on making this a public project having support for typescript will make it more friendly to contributors.

## Decision

Decision to use typescript was made.
