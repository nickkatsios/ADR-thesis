# 3. Use scalajs

Date: 31/06/2016

## Status

Accepted

## Context

To reduce the cognitive load on developers, and obviate the need for javascript, we will use a single 
language front and back. 

## Decision

Use scalajs on the client-side

## Consequences

Allows us to easily share code client and serverside, and move it front and back depending on needs
