# Decision

A lightweight, custom framework will be built.

# Detail

This framework will add a very thin layer above _dom_ and _html_ to handle componentization, but appart from that nothing fancy is required.

# Reason

Most frameworks are binding. The application becomes a `vue` app, or a `react` app. All these are relatively high-weight and complex, their need has not been proven for this app.
