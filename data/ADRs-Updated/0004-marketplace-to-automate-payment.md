# 4. marketplace to automate payment

Date: 2020-09-09

## Status

Accepted

## Context

Marketplace demos website to work on testnet only and automate the payment

## Decision

- use a defined wallet `demos_wallet` for payments
- the wallet will have lots of TFTs to use
- solutions to live max 3 hours

## Consequences

- Reduces the amount of clicks the users needs to go through to get a demo deployed and no money flow for them
- The package won't be usable as marketplace as it used to be, but probably ok it will be rethought anyhow with
