# Use AWS Cloud as a preferred cloud services provider

* Status: accepted

## Context and Problem Statement

There are different cloud service providers. Which one should be preferred?

## Considered Options

* **Use AWS Cloud as a preferred cloud services provider**
* Use Yandex Cloud
* No other options considered

## Rationale

AWS is the leading cloud service provider at the end of 2020. It’s considered the most mature provider offering the most diverse number of managed services. The decision driver is the assumption that the cost of the development can be simplified better with AWS Cloud than using other services. Yandex Cloud was considered due to the declared better pricing offering. Pricing concern doesn’t make sense before the product MVP proves a value.
