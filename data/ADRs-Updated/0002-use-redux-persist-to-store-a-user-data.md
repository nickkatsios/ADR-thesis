# 2. Use redux-persist to store a user data

Date: 2018-08-30

## Status

Accepted

## Context

We don't store any user data on back-end yet, so we can do it in AsyncStorage.

## Decision

We will use [redux-persist](https://github.com/rt2zz/redux-persist)
## Consequences

What becomes easier or more difficult to do and any risks introduced by the change that will need to be mitigated.
