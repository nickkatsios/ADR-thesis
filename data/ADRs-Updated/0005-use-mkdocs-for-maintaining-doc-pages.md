# 5. Use mkdocs for maintaining doc pages

Date: 2018-06-09

## Status

Accepted

## Context

javadocs are not very pleasant according to project marketing. 
We like an easy way to publish some techical articles related to our project

## Decision

1. We are using mkdocs with mkdocs gradle plugin to generate docs pages. 
2. We are going to host javadocs
3. Our architectural decisions also would be shared on pages
4. Pages would be hosted as github pages [plant-shop docs](http://wojciech.zarski.net/plant-shop)

## Consequences

1. Pages would be hosted as github pages [plant-shop docs](http://wojciech.zarski.net/plant-shop)
2. Confluence is not main point for documentation any more
3. Developers could feel lost, having many tools
4. Gradle configuration is going to be verboset
