# 48. Testing framework

Date: 2020-09-21

## Status

Accepted

Implements [4. Create software defined everything](0004-create-software-defined-everything.md)

## Context

The variety of JavaScript testing frameworks made available for automation testers have become a cause of confusion for many. It is only natural, the more options you have in front of you, the more time it will take for you to decide which JavaScript automation testing framework fits the best for you.

## Decision

We have decided to use the cypress testing framework for frontend and e2e testing.

## Consequences
