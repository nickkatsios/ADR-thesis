# Logo usage in our open source repos

## Decision
Having consulted with legal, we have reached the conclusion that we can:
 - We can't consume the `bpk-logos` package in our open-source repos.
 - We can't **store** logo assets (bitmaps or PNGs) in the open-source repos.
 - We can't **store** assets containing the logo (bitmaps or PNGs) in the open-source repos.
 - Logo assets shown on the docs site should be hosted on a CDN (or equivalent) instead.
