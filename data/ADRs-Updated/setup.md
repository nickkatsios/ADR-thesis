# Setup/Installation

## Prerequisites

Ensure you've installed the software outlined in the [prerequisites](https://github.com/naasse/ibm-quantum-challenge/blob/master/documentation/prerequisites.md) page.

## Database

Given ADR-1, our first setup task is to create our database.

See [here](https://github.com/naasse/ibm-quantum-challenge/tree/master/mongo) for more information.

## API Framework

Next, we need to set up Loopback.io for our project to handle the API/mid-tier.

See [here](https://github.com/naasse/ibm-quantum-challenge/tree/master/api) for more information.

## Frontend

The challenge did not call for a frontend, but since we're pretty close to finishing the full stack, let's create a simple React UI.

See [here](https://github.com/naasse/ibm-quantum-challenge/tree/master/frontend) for more information.
