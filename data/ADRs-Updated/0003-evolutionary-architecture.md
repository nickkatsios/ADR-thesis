# 3. Evolutionary architecture

Date: 2018-06-15

## Status

Accepted

## Context

There is a lot of things to learn, not only the ecosystem of clojure, we what create a high scalable application deploy in cloud, with autoscale, resilience, geographic distribution, multyples clouds providers, etc.

## Decision

We start with the most simple solution, a console application, after that we try to evolve to an API, Web Page, Microservices, etc.

## Consequences

A lot of refactors will be needed in the future, and throw code to the bin.
