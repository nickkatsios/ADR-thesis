# To adopt the lightweight architectural design decision format

## Context

This project is growing to the size and maturity where documenting the decisions made in its creation will be strongly beneficial.

The convention of lightweight architectural decisions [is set out by think relevance](http://thinkrelevance.com/blog/2011/11/15/documenting-architecture-decisions). It is set out in the form of an architectural decision document, and should be read as forming the basis of this document.

## Decision

For all architectural decisions in this project, we will create an architectural decision record with a filename of `XX-decision-title.md` where XX is the monotonically increasing number described in the linked document.

## Status

Proposed
