# Implement with Golang

## Status

Accepted

## Context

We need to choose a language to in which to code this project.

## Decision

Use Golang.

## Consequences

* We can compile a platform independent program with ease.
* It's not as typical for scripting as Bash, Ruby, or Python, making outside contributions less likely.
