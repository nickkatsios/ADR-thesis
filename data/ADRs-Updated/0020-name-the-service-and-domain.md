# 20. Name the service and domain

Date: 2018-08-28

## Status

Accepted

## Context

Until recently, we have been referring to this service by a temporary name - the
Data Submission Service - to distinguish it from MISO.

Following user research and the GDS [guidance][gds-guidance] on naming services,
we have now chosen the final name for the service.

In line with [ADR-0009][adr-0009], we also need to pick an appropriate domain
name to host the service.

## Decision

The service will be called: **Report Management Information.**

The service will use the domain name: **reportmi.crowncommercial.gov.uk**.

## Consequences

We will need to update the service and documentation to use the new name.
