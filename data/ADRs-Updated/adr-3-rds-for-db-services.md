# Amazon Relational Database Service (RDS) for Cloud DBMS Service

## Context

A self-service cloud database can make it easy to set up and manage a database in the cloud. Amazon RDS
meets several desired characteristics such as performance, robustness, database-independence, scaling, and
cost-effectiveness. 

## Decision

Amazon RDS will be used to persist digital objects data.

## Status

Accepted

## Consequences

This selection is dependent on the go-ahead from the infrastructure team. DOS itself does not strictly 
have a hard requirement for RDS.
