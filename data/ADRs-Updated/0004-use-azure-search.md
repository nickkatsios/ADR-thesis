# 4. Use Azure Search

Date: 2018-11-28

## Status

Accepted

## Context

Azure Search is the organisation/programme's strategic vision for serving both
organisation and service data. This removes the need to maintain an instance of
Elasticsearch and related infrastructure.

## Decision

The application will use Azure Search API to provide sexual health service
data.

## Consequences

The use of Elasticsearch (and related infrastructure) for sexual health service
searches will no longer be required.
