# 2. SQL database – PostgreSQL

## Status

Accepted

## Context

I start a public project for which architecture decisions can be seen as weird.

## Decision

I'm going to use as sql database – PostgreSQL database. I used to work with no-sql database (MongoDB) last 3 years, it's time to get used to sql database. PostgreSQL is free, mature and very popular (not only in side projects like this one).

## Consequences

I will learn PostgreSQL and if somebody would like to learn DDD from this repo – it should be easier for her/him, as PostgreSQL is commonly known.
