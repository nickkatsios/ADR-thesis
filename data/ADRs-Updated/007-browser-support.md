# 007: Browser support policy

Authors: @opqdonut

This ADR documents the current state of REMS browser support. If our
browser support policy changes, this document will be updated.

REMS is developed and tested with _up-to-date Chrome and Firefox_. No
other browsers are officially supported. Developers use _Linux and
macOS_, but we intend to support Windows as well. We try to keep the
website responsive on a best effort basis, but do not regularly test
with mobile browsers.

We test accessibility roughly once a month using a screen reader
(NVDA on Windows).
