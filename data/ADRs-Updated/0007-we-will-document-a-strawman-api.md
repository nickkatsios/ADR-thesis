# 7. We will document an API

Date: 2017-06-01

## Status

Accepted

## Context

The client and the service provider will have to communicate using some API.
We need to decide how the requests and responses will look like.

## Decision

We will use swagger to document the API between the client and the service-provider. This will form part of the documentation of a strawman that we send to our users.

## Risks

## Consequences

We will need to do some work to auto-generate the API documentation.
