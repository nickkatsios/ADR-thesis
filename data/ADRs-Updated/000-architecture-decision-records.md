# Lightweight Architectural Design Decision Format

## Context

This project is growing to the size and maturity where documenting the decisions made in its creation will be strongly beneficial.

Decisions are already being made in isolation without documentation and existing documentation around decisions is dispersed and hard to find.

The convention of lightweight architectural decisions [is set out by think relevance](http://thinkrelevance.com/blog/2011/11/15/documenting-architecture-decisions). It is set out in the form of an architectural decision record.

## Decision

For all architectural decisions in this project, an architectural decision record will be created with a filename of `XXX-decision-title.md` where XXX is the monotonically increasing number described in the linked document.

## Deprecated ADRs

When ADRs no longer apply, please move them to the `historic ADRs` folder, add `Status: Deprecated` at the top of the document and remove the numbering from the title of the ADR file.

## ADR proposals

When ADRs are proposals, please move them to the `ADR proposals` folder until they are approved.

## Status

Approved
