# 6. Use of migratus library
Date: 2018-06-15

## Status
Accepted

## Context
Direct form the [jdbc documentation](http://clojure-doc.org/articles/ecosystem/java_jdbc/home.html)

    Another common need with SQL is for database migration libraries. Some of the more popular options are:
    * Drift
    * Migratus
    * Ragtime 

## Decision
After a quick read of the documentation, and see that all solutions are similar, I select Migratus, by the comodity of have a lein plugin 

## Consequences
