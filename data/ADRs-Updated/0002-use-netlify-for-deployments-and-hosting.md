# 2. Use Netlify for deployments and hosting

Date: 2020-09-02

## Status

Accepted

## Context

GitHub Pages is a perfectly good static site host, however, not having the
ability for preview builds is problematic when wishing to test changes prior to
them being merged into the main branch. Netlify has the ability to create
preview builds for each PR or even each branch along with a number of other
benefits over GitHub Pages as can be seen in this (totally unbiased!)
[comparison](https://www.netlify.com/github-pages-vs-netlify/).

## Decision

The decision is to move hosting and deployment onto Netlify

## Consequences

Given the extremely low volume of usage this site achieves there are no
perceived negative consequences.
