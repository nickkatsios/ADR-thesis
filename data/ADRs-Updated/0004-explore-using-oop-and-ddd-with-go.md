Accepted

## Context

The issue motivating this decision, and any context that influences or constrains the decision.

I am comfortable writing Object Oriented code and using the Domain Driven Design tactical design patterns. 
I would like to leverage these approaches for this Go project and see how much my thinking has to change to adapt to the strengths of the Go programming language.    
 
## Decision

Use OOP and DDD tactical patterns where possible.  Recognise when to adapt and change if necessary.

## Consequences

There are some differences in Go that I am not yet used to so I may be refactoring code a lot as I learn how to do things in a more idiomatic Go style.
