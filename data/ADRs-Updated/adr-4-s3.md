# Amazon Simple Storage Service (S3)

## Context

DOS needs storage for digital object bitstreams (currently only PDFs and JPEGs). Amazon Simple Storage Service (S3) is a robust, scalable, and cost-effective object storage solution. S3 is already being used for various DLS projects and supported by the infrastructure team.

## Decision

AWS S3 will be used for storing bitstreams of digital objects.

## Status

Accepted

## Consequences

The DOS team will likely need to coordinate resource planning with the infrastructure team
as the number of digital files DOS needs to store in S3 is currently unknown. Any relevant decisions should be documented.
