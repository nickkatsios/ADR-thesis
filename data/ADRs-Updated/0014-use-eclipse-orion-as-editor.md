# Use Eclipse Orion as Editor

Editor should provide syntax highlighting and work in browser.

## Considered Alternatives

* [Eclipse Orion](https://wiki.eclipse.org/Orion)
* [Eclipse Che](https://www.eclipse.org/che/)
* [Codeanywhere](https://codeanywhere.com)
* [Cloud9](https://c9.io/)
* [Codiad](http://codiad.com/)
* [Theia](https://github.com/theia-ide/theia)

## Decision Outcome

* Chosen Alternative: Eclipse Orion
* Reasons: 
  * Extension of other IDEs either too time consuming or not possible.
  * Communication between other IDEs and Winery unclear.
  * Eclipse Orion was already used in the project.
