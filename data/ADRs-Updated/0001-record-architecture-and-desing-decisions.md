# 1. Record architecture and desing decisions

Date: 26.03.2020

## Status

Accepted

## Context

We need to record the architectural and desing decisions made during this project.

## Decision

We will use Architecture Decision Records, as described by
Michael Nygard in this article: http://thinkrelevance.com/blog/2011/11/15/documenting-architecture-decisions

Also https://medium.com/better-programming/here-is-a-simple-yet-powerful-tool-to-record-your-architectural-decisions-5fb31367a7da

## Consequences

Able to see motivation and history of architecture and desing decision and hopefully
provide context why some things are the way they are.
