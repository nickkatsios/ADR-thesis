# 11. yarn

Date: 2019-07-12

## Status

Accepted

## Context

We discussed the relative merits of different JS package managers.

## Decision

Use `yarn` instead of `npm` in all dev, test, and build environments.

## Consequences

This requires an additional install (`yarn`), but simplifies the overall development
and deployment pipeline.
