# Back End Decision record

* **Issue**: To support our frontend with deeper functionality and persistent storage in a database. Our project must perform actions “behind the scenes”, loading text from a selected website, saving users’ annotations for that text, and possibly archiving websites selected for annotation. We therefore need some sort of backend system capable of executing code and communicating between the frontend and the database.

* **Decision**: We decided to use Node.js as our backend framework.

* **Status**: Decided

* **Pros**: Healthy package ecosystem, lots of documentation and support

* **Cons**: Concerns over long-term stability due to package dependencies
