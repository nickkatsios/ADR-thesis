# 3. Use GitHub for code

Date: 2018-06-06

## Status

Accepted

## Context

We will be developing new code and applications during the build of the Data
Submission Service.

It is good practice to use version control to allow changes to be tracked over
time.

The Digital Service Standard [recommends][service-manual-version-control] the
use of version control for government services. It also recommends
[making all new source code open][service-standard-point-8].

Crown Commercial Service already uses Git for some systems, and has a
[GitHub][ccs-github] account.

## Decision

We will use Git and GitHub for storing our code.

We will use public repositories by default, unless there is a convincing reason
not to (which must be documented in the README of the private repository).

We will use the main [CCS GitHub][ccs-github] account and use their standards
for user account management.

## Consequences

None
