# 2. using react v16.8.0

Date: 2019-12-21

## Status

Accepted

## Context

Some libs from Apollo stack require react 16.8.0.

## Decision

To be consistent and maintain one react version accross application I will use react 16.8.0.

## Consequences

I need to monitor version upgrades accross all libraries to do a lock-step upgrade accross application.
