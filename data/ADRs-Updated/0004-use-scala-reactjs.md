# 4. Use scala reactjs

Date: 31/06/2016

## Status

Accepted

## Context

https://github.com/japgolly/scalajs-react

## Decision

Use reactjs with scalajs wrapping 

## Consequences

We're using a pre-version 1 of scalajs-react, it's a library that grew organically and has a few rough edges. 
At the time we chose it, there was active development on a new branch for a more 'designed' API, it's now released. 

React with scalajs gives us a UI that will be easier to reason about as it's built functionally.
