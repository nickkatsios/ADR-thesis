# To use Typescript as the programming language

## Context

We've found the use of strongly typed programming languages to be advantageous in reducing software defects. We have previously used Flow, however its error messages are regularly impenetrable. Without the burden of a legacy codebase to support, the benefits of Flow over Typescript are significantly less.

## Decision

We will use Typescript as the programming language for this project.

## Status

Accepted
