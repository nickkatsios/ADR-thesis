# 8. api-documentation

Date: 2019-07-01

## Status

Accepted

## Context

We want our [API](./0004-api.md) to be self-documenting and testable as we go.

## Decision

Use an [OpenAPI hex package](https://hexdocs.pm/open_api_spex) to automate OpenAPI tasks.

## Consequences

Generating, validating, coding, and testing our APIs is much faster and easier.
