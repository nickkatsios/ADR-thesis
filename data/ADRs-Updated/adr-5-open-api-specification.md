# OpenAPI Specification for Documenting the API

## Context

In accordance with our architecture principles (API first design), an API specification 
is required to specify and share information about DOS API end points. OpenAPI is supported by most API design tools and it is already being used to specify other DLS APIs.

## Decision

OpenAPI (Swagger) will be used.

## Status

Accepted

## Consequences

For additional use cases related to API management, an API platform that provides effective support for OpenAPI should be used.
