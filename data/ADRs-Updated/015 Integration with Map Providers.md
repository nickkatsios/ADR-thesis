Date: 2020-11-24

## Status

Proposed

## Context

Application should be integrated with 3rd party geolocation providers to help the user reach the location of the Smart Fridge. Currently, we consider below map providers to integrate with our application.

## Decision

Based on the business model and the volume of data now and in near future , as there will be more subscribed users, who knows the location precisely . We have decided to integrate with Here maps as it has good market reach and first 25K requests were free.

## Consequences

As of now 250K transactions per month looks decent for the business model , when the business grows, it should be ready to upgrade to premium solution

## Governance

While maintaining the application, there is a need of constant surveillance on the number of requests per month to avoid additional expenditure.
