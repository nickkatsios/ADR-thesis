# Single Page Application

## Context
Managing playing audio between page loads is impossible. This means that either, we use a pop-up player that plays audio in another window or we build a Single Page Application that doesn't perform page loads.
Building a single page application will add complexity and other issues to work around like SEO. Pop-up players are clunky, feel dis-jointed from the rest of the site and can be annoying to use in mobile browsers.


## Decision
Build a SPA.
