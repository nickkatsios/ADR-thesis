# 3. Spring Framework

Date: 2018-08-02

## Status

Accepted

## Context

Programming frameworks can promote the productivity of a project; producing smaller code bases, added reliability,
additional features (than one would otherwise write themselves), etc. 

## Decision

We have used the [Spring framework](https://spring.io/) within the team for a number of years, and its recent advances in the domain of REST applications makes it an ideal choice.

## Consequences

As stated by Spring themselves, they are an opinionated framework that guides the design of certain aspects of a codebase.
However, these 'opinions' are generally there for the benefit of a project, making it possible to achieve your goal.
