# 7. Use Kotlin

Date: 01-August-2017

## Status

Proposed

## Context

The code base is too verbose.

Could do with writing less code, but avoid too large a learning curve away from Java.

## Decision

We will assess the benefits of Kotlin by rewriting this application.

## Consequences

See the [Kotlinization](https://github.com/mahanhz/kotlinization) repository.

Also see the [article](https://dzone.com/articles/kotlinization) based on the experience of rewriting this application in Kotlin.
