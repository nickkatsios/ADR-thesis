# 57. Naming convention defines URI tags

Date: 2020-09-30

## Status

Accepted

Implements [9. URI identifies data](0009-uri-identifies-data.md)

Implements [29. Components are named according to naming conventions](0029-components-are-named-according-to-naming-conventions.md)

## Context

A Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) is a string of characters that unambiguously identifies a particular resource. To guarantee uniformity, all URIs follow a predefined set of syntax rules, but also maintain extensibility through a separately defined hierarchical naming scheme

## Decision

We will use [the 'tag' URI Scheme](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4151). 

## Consequences
