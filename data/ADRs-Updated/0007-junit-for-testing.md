# Use of JUnit5 for testing

* Status: accepted
* Deciders: [Q-tal EnPro Team]

## Context and Problem Statement

Since the project started out with both JUnit4 and JUnit5, we only want one unit-testing framework in order to make testing writing consistent. 

## Considered Options

* JUnit4
* JUnit5

## Decision Outcome

Chosen option: "[JUnit5]", because it is the newer version and therefore has a higher maturity and a wider feature-set.

### Positive Consequences <!-- optional -->

* Uniform tests
* More and newer features
