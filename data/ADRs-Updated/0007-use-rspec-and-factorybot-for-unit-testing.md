# 7. Use RSpec and FactoryBot for unit testing

Date: 2018-06-06

## Status

Accepted

## Context

We want a unit test framework that is more feature rich than MiniTest.
FactoryBot adds more features to test data than provided with fixtures.

## Decision

To add RSpec and FactoryBot to the project.

## Consequences

The tests will take a littel longer but will be easier to set up with complicated data.
