# ADR 2: Identify architecture components

## Context

The architectural technical material has no single definitive set of items identified as building blocks that can operate across all the departments and spaces at the same level of granularity in a re-usable way.

While this is the case if design and implementation are functions which generate outputs which cross between different spaces, friction and incompatibility are a problem.

## Decision

We will identify the component parts of technical guidance material we have collected and used to date across the spaces within architecture and will work to de-duplicate, and arrive at a shared understanding of the definition of these pieces.  We will in addition work to gain a shared understanding on what the correct level of granularity is for these working parts.

Not exhaustive yet, but below is our initial suggestion for a list of component types:

* goals
* principles
* anti-patterns
* patterns
* constraints
* decision trees

## Status

Accepted.

## Consequences

Requires some complex activity in de-duplicating artefacts across the different areas of the architecture.  Requires a decision making process to reach consensus on how to edit material so it is compatible as we collide it in a single repository.
