# 2. Name the project "Where Away?"

Accepted

## Context

The goal of the project is to make a lightweight, keyboard navigable set of
bookmarks. Basically the browser bookmark toolbar, but a webpage with
single-key navigation (like intelliJ or Excel when you press Alt and
numbers/letters show up on the actions so you can select them quickly). 

So, it's a link management tool.

Also, I'd like to publish it as a package to npm so that I can use it easily at
work. So, the name can't be taken in npm.

Some obvious ones that are taken:
 - linker
 - whereto

So how about obscure nautical terms? "Where Away?" means "Inquiry addressed to a
look-out man, demanding precise direction of an object he has sighted and
reported." [nautical glossary](http://www.marinewaypoints.com/learn/glossary/glossary.shtml)

I get a kick out of that, and `where-away` (and `whereaway`) are not taken on
npm at the time of writing.

## Decision

Call the package `where-away`.

## Consequences

It's not a common phrase, I'll need a README entry explaining the name. But,
probably I'll be the only one who uses this so even that isn't a big deal.
