# 40. Agile - Daily standup meeting

Date: 2017-06-16

## Status

Accepted

## Context

1. Team `devops` set up recently, we need some change to improve the performance;
2. No communication in the team, always person to person;
3. Tasks not organized well which spread among different projects;
4. Some teams require daily reports for their management, but lose the communication between team members.

## Decision

We're going to have 10 minutes daily standup meetings with each team so that We're on the same page about what everyone in the team is working on and we can strategize on how to approach the work items on the board for the day to come.

Effective standups are all about communication and commitment, not about status updates. So before every scrum take 5 minutes to actually think and note down what you were planning to accomplish yesterday, did you actually accomplish what you've committed to, if not why?

Take some time to plan your day and decide what you're going to accomplish today, commit to it and state it to the team (not the management), so the team members will keep each other accountable for the commitments they make to make the whole team improve together and make sure to remove impediments that prevent team members to accomplish what they plan.

Scrum master should pay more attention to the status of each card, encourage team members to deploy in time.

We change scrum master every two week to make sure all team members understand the details as an owner.

### Keynotes

* Safe time - make sure everyone free that time;
* Everyone should standup;
* Focus - Every should watching the board;
* Less than 10 minutes for the whole meeting;
* One minute per person, no more than two minutes;
* Remove impediments;
* What done yesterday;
* What will do today.

## Consequences

Everyone in the team will know each other better.
