## Status

Accepted

Relates to [3. Use familiar tools](0003-use-familiar-tools.md)

## Context

 - The problem instructions state "C++ or node.js are preferred".
 - I am most familiar with node.js out of those two.
 - I am completing this problem in my spare time and have a limited amount of
   time to spend on it: it's convenient to work faster if possible.

## Decision

Use Node.js to complete this problem.

## Consequences

Pro: 
 - I will be able to write faster because it's a familiar language

Con:
 - I won't be demonstrating that I can also write C++
