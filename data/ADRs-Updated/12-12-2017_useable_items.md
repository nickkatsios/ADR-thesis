# Create Useable Items

### Status: accepted

## Context: 

While we have a class for items already, we need a way for them to be used during combat. This way we can add in more items that will change the flow of battle and eventually a money and shop system to add to combat variation.

## Decision: 

Create a way to use items and integrate into the combat flow.

## Progress:

* Added healing items.
