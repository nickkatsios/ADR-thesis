# 5. Use Dependabot for dependent library vulnerability checking

Date: 2019-05-21

## Status

Accepted

## Context

We want to ensure we are made aware of vulnerabilities that are discovered in
third-party open source libraries the application uses and can quickly update
dependent libraries to secure versions so that we can be confident we are not
open to known security threats.

## Decision

We will run [Dependabot](https://dependabot.com), a third-party service that
automatically checks for known vulnerabilities and automatically creates Pull
Requests against the codebase to update vulnerable dependencies.

## Consequences

The team responsible for the codebase will still need to review, merge, and
deploy the Pull Requests to update the libraries on the live system.
