# ADR 3: Structure of a pattern

## Context

We need consistency in terms of format and structure for our patterns across the customer facing, integration and other architectures.

## Decision

We propose the following sections for pattern artefacts:

* Context
* Problem (optional)
* Solution 
* Examples
* Exceptions
  * Customer Facing
  * Integration Framework (Messaging)

## Status

Proposed

## Consequences

Stakeholder groups will need to re-factor the format and structure of pattern material in a later editing phase.  The first phase is to get the material into the repository.
