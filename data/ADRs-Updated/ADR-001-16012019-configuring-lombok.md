### **ADR-001 - Configuring Lombok**

**Context**

Current application was generated by Spring Initializr platform. We want to configure come useful libraries to avoid repeated code through our model classes.


**Decision**

Lombok (https://projectlombok.org/) is an useful library to avoid writing of getter, setter, constructor methods and allows to implement builder pattern just using annotations.

**Status**

Accepted

**Consequences**

Once implemented the Lombok dependency in the `build.gradle` file, we need to download the right plugin for our IDE in order to work without any compilation problems.
- For IntelliJ (And other JetBrains tools): https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/6317-lombok-plugin
- Once downloaded, enter to Preferences -> Build, Execution, Deployment -> Annotation Processors and enable the annotation processing.

Now we are ready to start using the Lombok features (https://projectlombok.org/features/all).
