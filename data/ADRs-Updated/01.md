# Architectural Decision: Storage

## priorities

- Available offline
- Available on mobile, desktop
- Minimal amount of code required to set up/ fetch from

## decision

- [Dexie.js](https://dexie.org/)

## alternatives considered

- Raw `localstorage`
  - Unwieldy, could cause backwards compatibility issues if formats ever change
- pouchdb
  - 115 kb of Javascript (10/2019) to fetch from local storage?
- Raw IndexDB
  - API is difficult to work with, 2.0 does not have solid browser support yet (10/2019)
