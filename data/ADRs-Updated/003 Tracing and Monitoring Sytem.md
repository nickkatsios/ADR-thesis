# 1. Tracing and monitoring system

Date: 2020-10-29

## Status

Proposed

## Context
This is a fast growing system and justin-time scaling is essential. Also, it allows buying cheaper instances for services without overall degradation.
Proper and trustworthy monitoring is the basis for making any decision about infrastructure changes (i.e. scaling and extracting services), proper monitoring should support business decisions and should act architecture fitness functions.
We'd like to use a system that helps us get the full picture of correlated business events, connected services and amount of consumed resources.

## Alternatives

#### DataDog

DataDog is a monitoring service for cloud-scale applications that allows for monitoring of servers, databases, tools, and services, through a SaaS-based platform.
DataDog platform allows to visualize metrics data on a dashboard, and provides alerting. Solution can be integrated with Amazon Web Services (AWS), Microsoft Azure, Google Cloud Platform, Red Hat OpenShift etcâ€¦ Cost of DataDog as a monitoring solution is **$15 USD per host, per month**

#### Graphana

Grafana is an open source solution for running data analytics, pulling up metrics that make sense of the massive amount of data & to monitor your apps with the help of customizable dashboards. Grafana connects with every possible database such as Graphite, Prometheus, Influx DB, ElasticSearch, MySQL, PostgreSQL etc. Solution is free of charge.

#### ELK Stack

"ELK" is the acronym for three open source projects: Elasticsearch, Logstash, and Kibana. Elasticsearch is a search and analytics engine. It allows us to aggregate logs, search on it and visualize it. Because it is an open source project there are no financial costs associated with buying the stack.

#### Amazon CloudWatch

Amazon CloudWatch is AWS alerting tool for sending notifications based on the severity levels of the inspected matrix. Approximate cost is $0.30 USD for first 10,000 metrics.

## Decision

Even though ELK stack or Graphana are the cheapest options for FoodFarmacy to go with, we decided to choose DataDog, because it requires minimal integration without maintenance (contrary to ELK Stack or Graphana). The convenience of an all-in-one alerting and monitoring tool for $15 USD per month is just too difficult to argue with. Finally, choosing an open-source solution we would have to appoint 0.2-0.5 time of a developer / administrator to take care of the monitoring.

## Consequences
We will have to spend $15 USD and the price might increase in the future. We think it unlikely it will be a significant increase. Reduced burden on maintenance due to DataDog being a managed service.
