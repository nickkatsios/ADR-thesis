# Create Caracter Creation

### Status: completed

## Context: 

We need a way for player characters to be generated intentionally where certain statistics can be decided on by the player instead of having a random outcome. This will give the player some opportunity to have some control over their character's strengths and weaknesses and add to the playability of the game.

## Decision: 

Create a player module with user interaction to affect the starting statistics of a character.
