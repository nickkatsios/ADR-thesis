# ADR2: Use React and Tailwind CSS for frontend
Date: 2021-02-03

## Status
Accepted

## Context
To make it easy for users to interact with our API we need a frontend that can be used by modern devices.

## Decision
The frontend will be build with [React](https://reactjs.org/) and [Snowpack](https://www.snowpack.dev) will be used as build tool.

The application will be styled with [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com)

We also considered the following alternative solutions:
* Vanilla HTML would work for the scope of this application.
* Vanilla CSS would work, but take more time to generate nice layouts.


## Consequences
