# 2. SYS - Pick documentation language

Date: 2020-09-16

## Status

Accepted

## Context

- We have polish development team, so all business related communication is in polish, 
- All team members prefer to write code in english,
- There is not much business facing documentation (BFD).

## Decision

- All BFD and artifacts will be in english (ES sessions, System Context diagram, e.t.c),
- All developer facing documentation and artifacts will be in english (Code, ADR, C2-C3 diagrams, e.t.c).

## Consequences

- We will maintain low friction communication with domain experts (feedback will be possible).
