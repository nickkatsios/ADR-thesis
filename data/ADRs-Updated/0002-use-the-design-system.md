# 2. Use the Design System

Date: 2021-01-28

## Status

Accepted

## Context

The uplift front-end work should be based on the [U-M Library Design System](https://design-system.lib.umich.edu/):

* The Digital Collections Platform long-term goal is that "DLXS collections" should blend with the Library (unless contrained by stakeholder requirements, e.g. the Bentley Library).

* Building templates against the Design System today should mean more of these templates can be re-purposed for however the DCP evolves.


## Decision

Use the Design System components and CSS to build out the uplift front-end.

Set a milestone to evaluate which (if any) uplift patterns can be extracted up to the Design System.

## Consequences

* DLXS development is not easily configured for modern front-end development; some research will be required to find a happy medium
