# Game Hosting

### Status

accepted


### Context

The current version of the game is not user friendly. It requires knowledge
and acces to a Linux command line.


### Decision

Create a web interface to host the hunts. To keep costs low, lets host it
on GitHub Pages.


### Consequences

- Easier User Experience
- Wider player base
- GUIs are complex to build
