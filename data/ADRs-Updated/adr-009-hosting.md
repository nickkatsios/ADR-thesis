# Hosting

## Context

* We have a Clojure application
* We do not know the security requirements for hiding the application
* We would rather not pay for hosting

## Decision

* We host on Heroku. A free PAAS provider.

## Alternatives Considered

* Microsoft Azure also offer free Clojure hosting. Heroku was preferred as the team already had logins.
