# Be transparent

Status: Accepted

## Context

NAV is paid for by the public for the purpose of providing public services. What
we produce should be open and available for the public.

## Decision

We should strive to be as transparent as possible, and work by the principle
"Open by default".

## Consequences

We use public repos and public communication channels.

This requires discipline in what and how we share knowledge and build services.
We must be conscious of security aspects from the start.
