## Context and Problem Statement

We need to provide a client software to consume the Monocle web API. This client software must be easily consumable via a WEB browser.

## Considered Options

* React

## Decision Outcome

Chosen option: "React".
Because it is a today standard. It provides a wide variety of libraries to ease building s complex UI. The React community is pretty large and lot of doc resources are available. Also as that library is popular, it might benefit the project in terms of external contributions.
