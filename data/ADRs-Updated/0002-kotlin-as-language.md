# 1. Kotlin as programming language

Date: 2017-06-30

## Status

Accepted 

## Context

We need to choose main language for the app.

## Decision

We use Kotlin because it is the main language in JetBrains. When the summer practice is ended, this will simplify maintenance and contributions from other JetBrains employees.

## Consequences

A favorite in open source DevOps community is Go. This may complicate contributions from people outside JetBrains.
