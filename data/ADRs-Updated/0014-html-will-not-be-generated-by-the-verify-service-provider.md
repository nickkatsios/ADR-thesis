# 14. HTML will not be generated by the verify service provider

Date: 2017-07-25

## Status

Accepted

## Context

As well as the SAML AuthnRequest something needs to render an HTML form to handle
the "SAML Post Binding". This form contains the SAML request, the relay state, and
optionally any "hints" the relying party needs to send the hub.

This form could either be generated by the verify-service-provider, the client library
(e.g. passport-verify), or the service itself.

## Decision

The HTML form will be generated by the client library.

## Consequences

Users of the verify-service-provider will not have to generate the form themselves (if
they use a client library).

It should be reasonably simple to allow users to customise how the form appears (e.g. for
users without JS).

We will have to write code to generate the form in every one of the client libraries we build.
