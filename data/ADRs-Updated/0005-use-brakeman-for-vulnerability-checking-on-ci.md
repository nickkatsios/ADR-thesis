# 5. Use Brakeman for vulnerability checking on CI

Date: 2019-04-04

## Status

Accepted

## Context

We want to ensure we're creating a secure application from the start, by adding
some vulnerability checking to our CI we can have confidence that we aren't
introducing known insecure code.

## Decision

We will run the Brakeman vulnerability check as part of our CI pipeline.

## Consequences

Brakeman is only a static code analyser, we will still need to check for
potential security issues as part of our code review process.
