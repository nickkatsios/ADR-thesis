# Create Random Character Generation

### Status: accepted

## Context: 

It is desirable that we have a way for characters to be randomly generated with different statistics and abilities in order to keep combat fresh and new with an element of surprise. Creating a way to generate random character systematically will keep us from having to create specific new characters.

## Decision: 

Create a random character factory that will pump out characters.
