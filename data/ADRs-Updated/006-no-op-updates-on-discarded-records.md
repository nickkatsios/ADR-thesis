# No-op updates on discarded records

*Note*: the term `soft-delete` is the same as `discarded` in the system.

## Context

The addition of soft-deletes means that we need a way to deal with updates 
that can happen on top of the soft-deleted records.

An example could be follows,

* Nurse A from Facility X soft-deletes BP#1 and syncs to the server
* Nurse B from the same Facility X updates BP#1 without syncing changes from Nurse A
* When Nurse B syncs, her update to BP#1 will take place, although on a technically soft-deleted record

All of this is an artifact of how the client decides to deal with this situation.

The client currently does not send `deleted_at: nil` for an update to a non-soft-deleted record. 
Since the app currently excludes all `null` values for serialization. 

If this behaviour changes in the future, wherein, the app sends `deleted_at: nil` for all requests, then we can get into
really hairy situations where one could _un-discard_ a record because of an un-synced update from a different client.

## Decision

Instead of relying on client-side behaviour, we will explicitly no-op the changes to soft-deleted records.

We can do this simply by introducing another `merge_status` in the `Mergeable` concern as `:discarded`.

## Status

Accepted

## Consequences

1. If we take the 2-nurse example described above, as a result of ignoring (no-op) the update from Nurse B, 
her updates will be effectively lost and the sync will eventually make the record invisible.

2. We need to be careful with resources that do merges which involve dependencies, like `Patient` â€“ so that we don't 
update the child-dependencies of soft-deleted records (like an `Address`/`PhoneNumber` for a `Patient`).

To elaborate on 2.,

The correct way to handle dependent no-ops, which is to say that if an update to a child record for a soft-deleted 
parent record is performed is to potentially consider cascading deletes.

For eg.,

If a patient is soft-deleted, then the children: `address`, `phone_number` etc. will also be soft-deleted. 
This will give us some benefits:

* It simplifies the code since each individual resource (child or parent) is itself soft-deleted, so we only need to 
handle the case for a single resource
* It logically makes sense to do a dependent delete of the whole tree, including in the future, where more than one
`address` or `phone_number` is associated to the patient.
