# Create Player Interface

### Status: completed

## Context: 

Need to create a way for the player to interact with their character and potential with their allies such that there is choice involved in combat on the player side instead of randomly decided actions.

## Decision: 

Create a child class of character to give branching functionality to player-specific characters.
