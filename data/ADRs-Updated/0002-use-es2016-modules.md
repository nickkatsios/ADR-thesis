# 2. Use ES2016 Modules

Date: 2017-12-01

## Status

Accepted

## Context

ES2016 introduced native support for the concept of modules. These are scoped files that expose some public functions. Modules are a way of organizing and sharing code.

## Decision

We will use ES2016 modules to organize and share code. More information can be found here: http://exploringjs.com/es6/ch_modules.html#sec_modules-in-javascript

## Consequences

Because of the nature of this project, this decision is made in lieu of choosing a framework. I want to be able to learn some of the new ES2016 features without a framework getting in the way.
