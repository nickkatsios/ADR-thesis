# 2. Use Black code formatter

Date: 2018-06-12

## Status

Accepted

## Context

We would like to use code formatter to standardize code look so we stop bothering about it
in code reviews and focus on how code actually works.

## Decision

We will use Black: https://github.com/ambv/black

## Consequences

Black is opinionated and uses double quotes, which some people don't like. But benefits prevails.
