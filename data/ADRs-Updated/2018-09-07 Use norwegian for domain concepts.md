# Use Norwegian for Domain Specific Concepts

Status: Accepted

## Context

We work with a domain that naturally contains a lot of very domain specific
words and phrases in Norwegian.

Translating them back and forth between english and norwegian requires a lot of
mental effort, reduces understanding and prohibits us from having an ubiquitous
language in the team.

The same in reverse goes for technical aspects and terminology. Translating them
to Norwegian removes a lot of cognitive understanding.

## Decision

Use English for technical terms and use Norwegian for business domain specific
terms.

## Consequences

Understanding and mapping terms between code and our solution model is easy.
