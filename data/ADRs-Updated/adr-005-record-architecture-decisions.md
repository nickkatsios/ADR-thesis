# 5. Record architecture decisions

Date: 2020-10-21

## Context

While we have already recorded architectural decisions for this project, there is no guidance to follow for writing new ones. Recently we found that creating a new ADR was [hindered](https://github.com/alphagov/email-alert-api/pull/1441#discussion_r508729384) by wanting to be consistent with the structure of previous ADRs.

## Decision

We will continue to use Architecture Decision Records, as described by Michael Nygard in this article: http://thinkrelevance.com/blog/2011/11/15/documenting-architecture-decisions.

We will adopt a structure for future ADRs that matches this document - the exemplar in [our Rails app conventions](https://docs.publishing.service.gov.uk/manual/conventions-for-rails-applications.html#documenting-your-decisions). We will not change how the files are named, to avoid breaking links that were never expected to change.

## Status

Accepted

## Consequences

ADRs preceding this one will have an inconsistent format to the ones that follow this.
