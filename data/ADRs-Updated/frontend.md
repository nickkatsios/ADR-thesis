# Front End Decision record

* **Issue**: To create a simple and dynamic user interface

* **Decision**: We decided to use Javascript with React as our frontend framework.

* **Status**: Decided

* **Pros**: Very popular, and have already been exposed to it during class. Better performance since our user can add annotations in their local application instead of making requests. Component-based framework, well documented.

* **Cons**: Not totally flexible, need to follow the routines
