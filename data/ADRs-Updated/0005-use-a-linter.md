Date: 2019-05-29

## Status

Accepted

Leads to [6. Use ESLint for linting](0006-use-eslint-for-linting.md)

## Context

This code will be reviewed in a job interview setting; the instructions specify
"production" level code.

"production" level code objective.

## Decision

Use a linter.

## Consequences

Code will follow a consistent style.
