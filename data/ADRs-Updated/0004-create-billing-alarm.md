# 4. Create Billing Alarm

Date: 2020-06-20

## Status

Accepted

## Context

There is a fixed amount of budget for this project, since this is supposed to be a micro scale project
and the costs of the resources used can go up pretty quickly.

## Decision

Create an alarm for billing, if the predicted billing for the month is more than $5.

## Consequences

A better management for the budget and cost monitoring.
