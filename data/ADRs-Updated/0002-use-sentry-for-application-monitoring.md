# 2. Use Sentry for application monitoring

Date: 2019-05-08

## Status

Accepted

## Context

Hackney have a preference for using this tool across their digital services: https://github.com/LBHackney-IT/API-Playbook#centralised-exception-logging

## Decision

Sentry will be the third party service we use for collecting and managing the exceptions for all environments.

## Consequences

It will be easier to hand over the service back to Hackney if we are using their tooling from the start, rather than dxw's preferences.
