# Title: 001 - Choose Spring Boot to Implement The Project


## Status

accepted


## Context

I have to choose a framework to implement moneycount-api project. It could be a familiar framework, such as Spring Boot, Spark, Servlets + Jersey or even Python + Flask, or I could try another different framework to learn something new.


## Decision

I decided to use Spring Boot 1.5.10, the last stable 1.X release at the time, because I want to have a first version of the software in a well known framework that allows me to implement it fast, with easy integration with other features that I can choose in future improvements.


## Consequences

As I have expertise using Spring Boot it will be fast to have a MVP. As a wide accepted framework, Spring Boot makes it easier to integrate with other tools such as cloud environments and CI tools.
