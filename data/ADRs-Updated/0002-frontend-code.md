# 2. Frontend Code

Date: 2019-03-06

## Status

Accepted

## Context

The front end needs to provide a rich user experience, be modular and performant with large community support.

## Decision

React.js is used as the frontend framework for building the new website. React.js is used with TypeScript, which is a superset of JavaScript.

## Consequences

- The declarative, component-based approach provided by React.js makes development of a modern web application easier.
- The use of TypeScript enables us to avoid bugs and makes it easier for developers to understande the code.
- React's virtual DOM makes it a performant framework.
- The popularity of React.js makes it easier to find documentation and for us to hire new developers.

Things to look out for:

- SEO and whether we need to use server-side rendering.
