# Interpreter

## Status
Rejected

Proposed by: Adam Gibson (28-09-2020)

Discussed with: N/A

## Context
 

## Decision

An interpreter uses the [import IR](./0003-Import_IR.md) and the [mapping rule IR](./0004-Mapping_IR.md)
to execute and map operations from one framework to nd4j's file format and back.

This also allows execution of different frameworks via conversion in the nd4j engine.


A combination of the 2 allows a uniform interface to be used for the interpreter.

1 or more MappingRules will be used to transform 1 file format to another.


## Mapping Rules Execution

Mapping Rules are named functions that contain the function signature
(input and outputs). These mapping rules are used by the interpreter
to know which functions to execute.

The interpreter has built in implementations of the defined functions
for the desired transforms.


## Import process

An import process is defined for an overall framework.
It maps input graphs to samediff graphs using
specified mapping processes for op names and frameworks.
An import process is all that is needed to create a graph.
Below are the needed concepts for an import process to implement. 


## Graph creation 

In order for execution to happen, a graph needs to be built.
This happens in java via the samediff builder.

The conversion happens as follows:
input node -> convert node to op descriptor via defined mapping rules -> add op descriptor to graph

The op descriptor is converted to a CustomOp which is then added to the graph via
[addArgsFor](https://github.com/KonduitAI/deeplearning4j/blob/88d3c4867fb87ec760b445c6b9459ecf353cec47/nd4j/nd4j-backends/nd4j-api-parent/nd4j-api/src/main/java/org/nd4j/autodiff/samediff/SameDiff.java#L1078)

This handles declarative graph creation setting dependencies up. Delegation of the graph structure
creation to the existing Samediff library enables the scope of this interpreter to be focused on 
mapping operations.

## Custom Sub graphs

One common use case is mapping sub graphs to custom layers. A custom layer can be thought of as a sequence  of operations.
In order to map this, a named process can be created. Generally, if you know what ops the sub graph is made of,
you only need to declare a set of rules based on the rules that map individual ops in the existing framework.

## Consequences
### Advantages
* Uses a common interface across different frameworks making maintenance simple

* Allows an easy to maintain abstraction for interop with different file formats

* Allows an easy entry point in to the framework without knowing much about the framework.

### Disadvantages

* Need to ensure compatibility across different frameworks

* Requires extensive testing to ensure proper compatibility

* May not necessarily support all ops people are expecting. This will be addressed
in a new ADR.
