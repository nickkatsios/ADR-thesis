# 2. Use the stack from `React the complete guide` to keep up to date with React

Date: 2019-02-06

## Status

Accepted

## Context

I need to decided with which tools I build my react app.

## Decision

I build the react app using [`React - The Complete Guide (incl Hooks, React Router, Redux)`](https://www.udemy.com/react-the-complete-guide-incl-redux/). 

## Consequences

this makes it easy to start again and grow from there because I don't use boilerplates like `react-boilerplate`. Because the ecosystem is moving fast and if you don't work with the stack daily you keep get lost. Using this guide that is detailed and kept up to date allows me to start again after a longer break as well as keep up to date and have a clear location where I can start again.
