# 2. Use Next.js

Date: 2019-10-08

## Status

Accepted

## Context

We want to be able to support full-featured React apps, without reinventing the
wheel when it comes to routing and server-side rendering.
[Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) is a framework that supports these features out
of the box.

## Decision

We will use Next.js as the basis for the project.

## Consequences

Next.js handles all the tooling we need to build and run a server-side rendered
React app.
