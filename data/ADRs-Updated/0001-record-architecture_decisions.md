# 1.  Record architecture decisions

Date: 2020-06-17

Accepted

## Context

This project is design to explore architecture, so I have to record my decisions.

## Decision

For all architectural decisions Architecture Decision Log (ADL) is created. All decisions will be recorded as Architecture Decision Records (ADR). 

Each ADR will be recorded using [Michael Nygard template](http://thinkrelevance.com/blog/2011/11/15/documenting-architecture-decisions), which contains following sections: Status, Context, Decision and Consequences.

## Consequences

All architectural decisions should be recorded in log. Old decisions should be recorded as well with an approximate decision date. New decisions should be recorded on a regular basis.
