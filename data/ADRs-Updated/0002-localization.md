- resource bundles
- using javax validation message interpolator?


- constraints will have a default message whose format will be similar to hibernate validators
- can override constraint message via `withMessage` which can be a static string or a string in a resource file
  - how to delineate between the two? 

Subject -> constraints  
Subject -> constraint withMessage
