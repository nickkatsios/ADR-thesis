## Milestone

0.1.0

## Context

For the project it is useful to keep all the architectural decisions documented in one place.

## Decision

All development related decisions must be documented in ADRs.

## Consequences

### Pros:

- Easy and fast to look up all architectural decisions.
- Learn to stick to a decision until other proves being better.

### Cons:

- Write for every time a new decision is made a new markdown file :-D
