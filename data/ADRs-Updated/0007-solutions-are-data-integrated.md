## Context

Data integration involves combining data residing in different sources and providing users with a unified view of them for both operational and analytical uses. Data integration encourages collaboration between internal as well as external users.

Given an application landscape with a large variaty of application types (legacy, on-prem, SaaS, ...), business owners and parties involved, data integration can be challenging. Therefore it is important to make sure the need for data integration is recognized by all parties involved and technical knowledge is available for systems involved.

## Decision

We integrate data through the ODH. Therefore we only make or buy solutions supporting this.

## Consequences

### Advantages

Integration helps businesses succeed. Even if a company is receiving all the data it needs, that data often resides in a number of separate data sources. Information from all of those different sources often needs to be pulled together for analytical needs or operational actions, and that can be no small task for data engineers or developers to bring them all together. Conducting all these operations as efficiently as possible highlights the importance of data integration.

Improves collaboration and unification of systems. Employees in every department — and sometimes in disparate physical locations — increasingly need access to the company’s data for shared and individual projects. IT needs a secure solution for delivering data via self-service access across all lines of business.

Saves time and boosts efficiency. When a company takes measures to integrate its data properly, it cuts down significantly on the time it takes to prepare and analyze that data.

Reduces errors (and rework). There’s a lot to keep up with when it comes to a company’s data resources. Without a data integration solution that synchronizes data, data must be manually updated to account for any changes. With automated updates, however, up-to-date data is easily available in real time, whenever needed.

Delivers more valuable data. Data integration efforts actually improve the value of a business’ data over time. As data is integrated into a centralized system, quality issues are identified and necessary improvements are implemented, which ultimately results in more accurate data — the foundation for quality analysis.


### Disadvantages

How to get to the finish line. Companies typically know what they want from data integration — the solution to a specific challenge. What they often don’t think about is the route it will take to get there. Anyone implementing data integration must understand what types of data need to be collected and analyzed, where that data comes from, the systems that will use the data, what types of analysis will be conducted, and how frequently data and reports will need to be updated.

Data from legacy systems requires a lot of effort. Integration efforts may need to include data stored in legacy systems. That data, however, is often missing markers such as times and dates for activities, which more modern systems commonly include.

External data. Data taken in from external sources may not be provided at the same level of detail as internal sources, making it difficult to examine with the same rigor. Also, contracts in place with external vendors may make it difficult to share data across the organization.

Keeping up. Once an integration system is up and running, the task isn’t done. It becomes incumbent upon the data team to keep data integration efforts on par with best practices, as well as the latest demands from the organization and regulatory agencies.
