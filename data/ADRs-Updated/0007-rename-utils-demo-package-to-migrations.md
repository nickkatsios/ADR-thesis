# 7. Rename utils-demo package to migrations

Date: 2019-12-12

## Status

Accepted

## Context

We use the `utils-demo` package to deploy the whole Origin system. After receiving some feedback, we noticed that the name `utils-demo` didn't reflect the true intention of that package.

## Decision

We've decided to rename the `utils-demo` package to `migrations` and publish it on NPM.

## Consequences

The name of the package now more closely reflects it's purpose.
