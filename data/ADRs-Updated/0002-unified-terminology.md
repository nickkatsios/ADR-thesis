# 2. Unified Terminology

Date: 2020-04-25

## Status

Accepted

## Context

It is easy to use different terms meaning the same thing in code. A common aphorism is that the most difficult thing in coding is naming.

## Decision

A `Terminology.md` document will be created, that will be used to collect the official terms for the project. If naming diverts from this terminology, it should be considerd a bug.

## Consequences

New code need to adhere to terms found in Terminology.md, the document should become augmented as the project progresses, and other terms as those found in the terminology document should not be used.
