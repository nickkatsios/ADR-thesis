# ADR 0002: Use Haskell

Date: 2018-09-30

## Status

Accepted

## Context

The reason I am building this project is to experiment with different architectures for video games
and I'm particularly interested in how functional programming applies to games.

Since this is a personal project, it should be fun. Right now I find functional programming more
fun the other paradigms, and I find static types more fun then dynamic types.

Additionally, I'm trying to get better at Haskell.

Therefore, Haskell seems like an obvious choice.

## Decision

I'm using Haskell!

## Consequences

- The game will be written in Haskell!
