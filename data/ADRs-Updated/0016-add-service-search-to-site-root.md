# 16. Add /service-search to site root

Date: 2019-11-08

## Status

Accepted

## Context

Sitting directly on the `/find-a-pharmacy` path is not in keeping with the organisations plans for 
information architecture going forward. When the service moves from beta.nhs.uk to nhs.uk we want
it to sit on path consistent with other finder services.

## Decision

The site root will be changed to be `/service-search/find-a-pharmacy`

## Consequences

The URL will be consistent with other selected services on nhs.uk
