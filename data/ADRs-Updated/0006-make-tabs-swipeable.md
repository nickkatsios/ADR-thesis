# 6. Make tabs swipeable

Date: 2018-09-12

## Status

Accepted

## Context

To navigate between tabs, users can swipe left or right or click a tab.

## Decision

We will use NativeBase's component "Tabs".
Previously used [react-native-tab-view](https://github.com/react-native-community/react-native-tab-view) since it's a cross-platform component that works perfectly on iOS and Android.

## Consequences

It renders inactive tabs.
