# 2. Use the adr-tools kit to manage adr docs

Date: 2018-05-25

## Status

Accepted

## Context

To help automated the process of managing architectual decision records use a tool that stanadardizes the process.
I found a reference to this tool on the thought works techninques review page.  The github repo is:
`https://github.com/npryce/adr-tools`

But I installed it using brew:
`brew install adr-tools`

## Decision

We will use the system adr-tools to manage the ADR documents


## Consequences

Training and documentation will be required.  We will need to have a shared understanding of the fields.
