## Context

We want our code repositories to be as user-friendly as possible. We have already created a document defining best practices as agreed by all teams on what a good `README.md` file and repository is and have applied this to our existing repositories.

This guide can be found on our [OPG Technical Guidance - Repo Readme Principles](https://docs.opg.service.justice.gov.uk/documentation/guides/repo_principles.html#repo-readme-principles) page.

### Decision

We should continue to follow our own guidance that was created as a community and update our code bases with new practices as required.

We should ensure any new practices are recorded in the [OPG Technical Guidance - Repo Readme Principles](https://docs.opg.service.justice.gov.uk/documentation/guides/repo_principles.html#repo-readme-principles) page.

### Consequences

#### Positive

* Any team is able to know how to navigate each repository
* Individuals are able to get setup in a project quickly
* You are able to find technical decisions made and their reason

#### Negative

* Older repositories may fall behind if not kept up to date
* Teams must remember to update the source of truth with any new decisions
