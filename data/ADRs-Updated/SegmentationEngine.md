# Title
Should we have a Segmentation Engine?

## Status

superseded

## Context

The purpose of Segmentation engine are:
- grouping of customers' goals
- targeted groups 
- history
- purchasing behaviour
- eating habit, location
- managing coupons and promotions 

What is the difference between Recommendation and Segmentation engines?

## Decision

It was decided to not have it.

## Consequences

Potentially an additional component that does a very similiar thing as the Recommendation manager
