Date: 2019-04-09

## Status

Accepted 

## Context

16-25 April, Thabang is away, must work remotely. Major submission period over 29th April - 10th May, will impact productivity on software project.


## Decision

4 Sprints planned, consecutively. Will only start on 17th April, but have a "Sprint 0" from 9th to 16 April, with initial planning, research and folder structure creation, setup of Azure and Travis. Will not count towards actual number of sprints.

* Sprints will begin on Wednesdays, with a 1 hr review session in the morning.
* There will be a three hour sprint planning session in the afternooon each Wednesday.
* Release will be every Tuesday, by 8pm
* Product release window will be from 2pm - 8pm, with all pull requests done before 6pm to give time for any required last minute code review and testing

* Friday coding sessions together from 12pm - 4pm
* Standups via Whatsapp, or between lectures. Preferable to do in person but may not be possible.

Rebecca: Product Manager
Tyson: SCRUM Master

Theese roles will be alternated throughout the project each week.

## Consequences

Weekends, Tuesdays and Mondays are the most productive working days for all members of the project. Stand ups will happen in person whenever possible, but with diverse schedule of members, may have to use WhatsApp video chats instead.
