# 3. Use Javascript over Typescript

Date: 2019-02-06

## Status

Accepted

## Context

I need to decide in which language I implement the frontend.

## Decision

I use Javascript. 

## Consequences

bcause I can use the tutorials as is and this improves (learning) speed. And the typescript adoption is not mainstream enough as well as even Typescript developers [need to know Javascript](https://www.techrepublic.com/article/is-javascript-about-to-be-superseded-by-typescript/).
