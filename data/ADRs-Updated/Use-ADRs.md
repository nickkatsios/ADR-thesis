# Architecture Decision Records

Date: 02/10/2019

## Context

We need to record the architectural decisions made by the project.

## Decision

We will use Architecture Decision Records(ADRs), as described by Michael Nygard in [this article](http://thinkrelevance.com/blog/2011/11/15/documenting-architecture-decisions).
Further background reading can be found [here](https://www.thoughtworks.com/radar/techniques/lightweight-architecture-decision-records)

## Consequences

Architecture decisions will be recorded in markdown files here. Use [this template](ADR-template.md) and add the decision as a link in the directory's Readme file. This will enable everyone who can read this repo to view the decisions and challenge them through the normal processes.
