# 2. Use akka

Date: 2018-06-01

## Status

Accepted

Amplifies [3. Use Scala as programming language](0003-use-scala-as-programming-language.md)

## Context

We need to be able to monitor network services separately.

## Decision

We will use _akka_ for managing the task to monitor a particular network service.

## Consequences

_akka_ is a new tool that we need to learn and master.
_akka_ is available in _Scala_ and _Java_. But the use of _Scala_ is more widely spread and more support is available in _Scala_.
