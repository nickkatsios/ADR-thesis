# Potential Topics

1. Localization
2. Comparables
3. Type Hierarchies 
4. RuleForEach style (include sample of a predicate on the rule and a predicate on the forEach)
5. Iterables vs Iterators
6. Code structure (Might be similar to type hierarchies)
7. along with comparables and code structure explain the need for individual number subject classes? --> Probably not needed
8. primitive arrays - https://stackoverflow.com/questions/26957008/generic-methods-for-primitive-types-in-java
