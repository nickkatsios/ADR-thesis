# 1. Thymeleaf for View

Date: 07/07/2017

## Status

Accepted 

## Context

We need to choose view representation

## Decision

We use Thymeleaf because it provides:
- clean HTML view
- templates that can be run without server

## Consequences
Maybe in the future we rewrite all frontend to React.js, but thymeleaf is good to start
