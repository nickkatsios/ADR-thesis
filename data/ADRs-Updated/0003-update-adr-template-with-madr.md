## Context and Problem Statement

We have been neglected to update ADR for a while. During this period some decisions have been made but there are no records for these. Because of this, some topics have been also talked again and again. We want to start and continue recording of Architecture Decision.

## Decision

We update out ADR template with called [Markdown Architectural Decision Records(MADR)][1]. We are inspired its approaches and also updated some sections according to our use cases.

### Positive Consequences 

* The new template is new motivation source to record decisions.
* The new structure is lean and comprehensible.
