## Context

Github is our git repository, and it holds our entire codebase. To improve the tracking of issues and collaborations, we must ensure consistent writing and communication.

## Decision

An easy way to improve our communication is by creating templates for both `issues` and `pull requests`. Those templates must be simple, easy to use, and express all required sections for our developers and users.

You can check the suggested templates [in the following folder](../assets/0002-github-template-for-issues-and-pull-requests).

## Status

Accepted.

## Consequences

We should watch out for any required improvement in those templates since this is a generic way of solving specific problems for all projects. Any team can use their templates, but the company suggested a template should improve based on our developers' feedback.
