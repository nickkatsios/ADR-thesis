# 3. Create cloud native solutions

Date: 2020-09-21

## Status

Accepted

Implemented by [56. Deploy on Google Cloud Platform](0056-deploy-on-google-cloud-platform.md)

## Context

Cloud-native architecture fully takes advantage of the [serverless computing](0002-use-serverless-infra-components.md) to maximise your focus on writing code, creating business value and keeping customers happy.

All the developer has to worry about is orchestrating all the infrastructure they need ([sofware defined](0004-create-software-defined-everything.md)) and the application code itself.

## Decision

We will build cloud-native solutions.

## Consequences

### Advantages

A modern cloud-native application supports DevOps processes, further enabling this automation and collaboration which was not possible in the era of local development and limited server-based software delivery processes.

Because of this design, even when failures happen you can easily isolate the impact of the incident so it doesnâ€™t take down the entire application. Instead of servers and monolithic applications, a cloud-native architecture helps you achieve higher uptime and thus further improve the user experience.

### Disadvantages

Potential vendor lock-in due to cloud provider specific functionality that is not easily portable to other cloud providers.

A cloud-native solution often involves many cloud components interacting together. To maximise the benefits of the cloud-native architecture, these components should be loosely coupled resulting in a maintainable solution. A poor design will lead to low reliability and bad maintainability.
