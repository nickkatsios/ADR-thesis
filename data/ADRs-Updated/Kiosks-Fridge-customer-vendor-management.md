# Title
Should we have a Kiosks-Fridge-customer-vendor-management component

## Status

superseded

## Context

Do we need a Kiosks-Fridge-customer-vendor-management to manage kiosks, fridge, customer and vendor?

## Decision

We will have separate components to manage kiosks (along with point of sale systems), fridges, customers and vendors

## Consequences

Rather than having one manager to take care of kiosks, fridges, customers and vendors, we have them as individual components.  We might have more components but they all have differents functionalities, this makes it easier to manage.
