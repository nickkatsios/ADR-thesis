# 2. Use clojure

Date: 2018-06-15

## Status

Accepted

## Context

As developer, I have a good understanding of clujure language, but not the ecosystem. How persist in db, create api's, secure them, etc.

## Decision

This will be a pet project, the goal is learning clojure ecosystem, not the aplication itself.

## Consequences
