# 6. Provide a hook for different types of sherd

Date: 2018-08-20

## Status

Accepted

## Context

At the moment, sherds are merely a short bit of free text.

To extract useful information, it will be useful to have some standard event types, such as team members joining or leaving.  These event types would have a well defined structure -- maybe still be Markdown, but with constraints on the content and markup used -- and be generated by convenient subcommands of the `pottery` tool.

## Decision

Add the event type to the sherd filename, after the date but before the unique ID.  The parts of the filename are separated by underscores.

The event type is a short string that cannot contain an underscore.

Free text sherds have the event type "post".


## Consequences

We can add new event types with defined formats.

It is no easier (but no more difficult) to parse the date from the sherd filename.
