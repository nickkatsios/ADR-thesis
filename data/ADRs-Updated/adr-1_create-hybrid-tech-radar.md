# ADR 1: Create Hybrid Tech Radar

## Context

Technical material is not unified across the different Architecture spaces.  Additionally material is not consistently broken down and represented even within a single one of those spaces.  We need to increase consistency, accuracy and re-usability, and remove ambiguity to permit a better technical toolkit to be created to decentralise architecture, and implementation across the delivery centres.  There has been no shared understanding on what the pieces that comprise a technical toolkit should be.

Some material has not been maintained/updated and the work has not been opened to a large enough pool of contributors.

There is not a high enough level of engagement with technical material across many distributed teams to achieve a high enough level of quality according to a set of standards designed to support operational strategies.

## Decision

We will create a hybrid Tech Radar, fully describing a set of lego building blocks for forming architectural material usable across the entire architecture.  We will reach a shared understanding on the level of granularity is with our building blocks, and in terms of the definitions of what those building blocks are.

The tech radar will be dropped periodically with updates to increase and maintain engagement with the material.

Material will be labelled across several axes (TBC) to provide indications on maturity of content, and suitability or relevance to different audiences etc.

## Status

Accepted.

## Consequences

Requires some complex activity in de-duplicating artefacts across the different areas of the architecture.  Requires a decision making process to reach consensus on how to edit material so it is compatible as we collide it in a single repository.
