# Expose versions data through the collection API

- Date: 2023-10-25

## Context and Problem Statement

### Context

The need to extend the current API comes as part of our collaboration with Terms of Service; Didn't Read (ToS;DR), whose web application will be adapted to obtain data from public Open Terms Archive collections instead of the ToS;DR server database.

The terms annotated by ToS;DR are currently taken from original web documents stored on the ToS;DR server database. Open Terms Archive provides a significantly higher quality source for terms, for example by cleaning up all content that is not related to the terms, combining documents scattered across several pages, or normalising PDF documents into Markdown.

To allow the transition from historical ToS;DR's crawler and database to the publicly accessible Open Terms Archive collections, ToS;DR requires access to the content of the versions. Datasets are not satisfactory as they are produced on a weekly basis, whereas a workflow supporting annotation of just-added terms is required by ToS;DR. This RFC outlines possible implementations of an API providing this data.

## Proposed solutions

### Solution A

#### Base URL

`<collection host>/api/:version`

#### Endpoint

##### `GET /version/:serviceId/:termsType/:date.md`

Return the Markdown content of the version of the terms that was applicable at the given date

##### Parameters

| Parameter | Type   | Description            |
| --------- | ------ | ---------------------- |
| serviceId | URL-encoded string | The ID of the service |
| termsType | URL-encoded string | The name of terms type |
| date | URL-encoded ISO 8601 datetime string | The date and time for which the version is requested |

Note about the date:
- A full date and time is required, and not a simple date (such as `2023-10-24`), to avoid ambiguities on days where a version changed, and timezone differences between client and server.
- It is not required that this date matches exactly the fetch date of a version. As versions are fetched at a periodic interval, the version that will be returned will be the one that was applicable at the provided date.
- To get the latest version available, simply use the current date as parameter.

##### Returns

- HTTP 200 with the Markdown content as body when a version is found for this date
- HTTP 404 Not Found with JSON content `{"error": "No version found for date <requested-date>"}` for a date that is anterior to the first available version
- HTTP 400 Bad Request with JSON content `{"error": "Requested version is in the future"}` if the date is in the future.

##### Example

```
GET /version/Open%20Terms%20Archive/Privacy%20Policy/2023-10-24T14%3A41%3A42.381Z.md
```
```markdown

### Solution B

#### Base URL

`<collection host>/api/:version`

#### Endpoint

##### `GET /version/:serviceId/:termsType/:date`

Returns a JSON object containing the version content valid for the given date along with metadata.

##### Parameters

| Parameter | Type   | Description            |
| --------- | ------ | ---------------------- |
| serviceId | URL-encoded string | The ID of the service |
| termsType | URL-encoded string | The name of terms type |
| date | URL-encoded ISO 8601 datetime string | The date and time for which the version is requested |

Note about the date:
- A full date and time is required, and not a simple date (such as `2023-10-24`), to avoid ambiguities on days where a version changed, and timezone differences between client and server.
- It is not required that this date matches exactly the fetch date of a version. As versions are fetched at a periodic interval, the version that will be returned will be the one that was applicable at the provided date.

##### Returns

- HTTP 200 with a JSON object containing the Markdown content as body when a version is found for this date
- HTTP 404 Not Found with JSON content `{"error": "No version found for date <requested-date>"}` for a date that is anterior to the first available version
- HTTP 400 Bad Request with JSON content `{"error": "Requested version is in the future"}` if the date is in the future.

##### Example

```
GET /version/Open%20Terms%20Archive/Privacy%20Policy/2023-10-24T14%3A41%3A42.381Z

}
```

### Solution C

This solution aims at allowing caching and providing metadata through standard HTTP methods. By redirecting to the canonical version name instead of replying with the applicable content, we enable proxies, the server and the user agent to leverage ETags cache the actual content, which might be several hundreds of kB. It also enables the client to know the time of record of the version.

#### Base URL

`<collection host>/api/:version`

#### Endpoint

##### `GET /version/:serviceId/:termsType/:date.md`

Identifies the Markdown content of the version of the terms that was applicable at the given date and provides its contents.

##### Parameters

| Parameter | Type   | Description            |
| --------- | ------ | ---------------------- |
| serviceId | URL-encoded string | The ID of the service |
| termsType | URL-encoded string | The name of terms type |
| date | URL-encoded ISO 8601 datetime string | The date and time for which the version is requested |

Note about the date:
- A full date and time is required, and not a simple date (such as `2023-10-24`), to avoid ambiguities on days where a version changed, and timezone differences between client and server.
- To get the latest version available, simply use the current date as parameter.

##### Returns

- HTTP 200 with the Markdown content as body when a version is found for this exact date
- HTTP 302 with the content when a version is applicable at this date, with the `Location` field of the response giving the exact date
- HTTP 404 Not Found with JSON content `{"error": "No version found for date <requested-date>"}` for a date that is anterior to the first available version
- HTTP 400 Bad Request with JSON content `{"error": "Requested version is in the future"}` if the date is in the future.

##### Example

```
GET /version/Open%20Terms%20Archive/Privacy%20Policy/2023-10-24T14%3A41%3A42.381Z.md

### Solution D

Solution D is a combination of all A, B and C aiming at keeping the best parts of each:

- A for ease of content access
- B for metadata extensibility
- C for performance capabilities

It has the added benefit of being possibly split in implementation in two parts, which are made clear in the proposal.

#### Base URL

`<collection host>/api/:version`

#### Endpoint with JSON content-type

##### `GET /version/:serviceId/:termsType/:date`

Return the contents of the version of the terms that was applicable at the given date, with metadata, in JSON format.

##### Parameters

| Parameter | Type   | Description            |
| --------- | ------ | ---------------------- |
| serviceId | URL-encoded string | The ID of the service |
| termsType | URL-encoded string | The name of terms type |
| date | URL-encoded ISO 8601 datetime string | The date and time for which the version is requested |

Note about the date:
- A full date and time is required, and not a simple date (such as `2023-10-24`), to avoid ambiguities on days where a version changed, and timezone differences between client and server.
- To get the latest version available, simply use the current date as parameter.

##### Returns

- HTTP 200 with a JSON object as body when a version is found for this exact date, containing metadata and a `content` property with the Markdown content, JSON-escaped
- HTTP 302 with the content when a version is applicable at this date, with the `Location` field of the response giving the exact date
- HTTP 404 Not Found with JSON content `{"error": "No version found for date <requested-date>"}` for a date that is anterior to the first available version
- HTTP 400 Bad Request with JSON content `{"error": "Requested date <requested-date> is in the future, no version can exist there"}` if the date is in the future.

## Decision Outcome

[After consulting the community](https://github.com/OpenTermsArchive/engine/pull/1028), the solution E is retained. It integrates the content accessibility of Solution A and the metadata extensibility of Solution B. It also avoids introducing early performance optimisations at this stage.
