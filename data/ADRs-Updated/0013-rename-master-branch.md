# 13. Rename cf-k8s-networking master branch to develop

Date: 2020-06-26

## Status

Accepted

## Context

A [proposal](https://lists.cloudfoundry.org/g/cf-dev/topic/75070528#9059) was
made on the cf-dev mailing list to rename our `master` branch to `main` to make
the CF community a more welcoming and inclusive environment.

## Decision

We are going to rename our `master` branch to `develop`. `develop` was chosen
instead of `main` by team consensus because it better describes the use of the
branch.

## Consequences

- Better description of what the branch is used for
- May not be consistent with other teams in the foundation. However, it was also
  decided that if consistency is more valuable, it is a quick change to use
  whatever the foundation consensus is.
