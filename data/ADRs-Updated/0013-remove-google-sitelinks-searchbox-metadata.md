# 13. Remove Google Sitelinks Searchbox Metadata

Date: 2019-03-18

## Status

Accepted

Supercedes [11. Add Google Sitelinks Searchbox metadata](0011-add-google-sitelinks-searchbox-metadata.md)

## Context

Metadata had previously been added to the site with the intention of having a search box appear within the results on Google to allow people to perform a search on our site directly from Google. This never ended up working and no search box has been placed by Google within the search results.

## Decision

The decision is to remove the code from within the application as it is effectively redundant.

## Consequences

The code base becomes a little cleaner and clearer.
