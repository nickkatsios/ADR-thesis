# 3. Use React-Native

Date: 2018-05-16

## Status

Accepted

## Context

When we started OpenCHS, we wanted to choose between native development and React Native. The reasons to choose RN are
 - React-Native is mature
 - It has a comparatively lower learning curve for the team
 - Development cycles are faster compared to native

## Decision

OpenCHS client will use react-native. 

## Consequences

 - Cannot use latest android APIs
 - Customization is good enough for a business app, complex animations might get hard
