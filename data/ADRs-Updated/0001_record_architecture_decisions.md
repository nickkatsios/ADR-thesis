# 1. Record Architecture Decision

## Status

Accepted

## Context

I start a public project for which architecture decisions can be seen as weird.

## Decision

I will record architecture decisions as documents in `doc/adl` folders â€“ `documentation / architecture decision log`

## Consequences

The motivation behind previous decisions is visible for everyone, present and future. Nobody is left scratching their heads to understand, "What were they thinking?" and the time to change old decisions will be clear from changes in the project's context.
