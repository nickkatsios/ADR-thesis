# SwaggerHub for API Documentation

## Context

We need a tool to design and document the DOS API. Options include SwaggerHub, etc.

## Decision

SwaggerHub will be used to document the API specification.

## Status

Accepted

## Consequences

In future, functionality will likely be needed to manage access to this API and to facilitate 
the API lifecycle. Once the API management software becomes available, DOS API will need to be ported
to the new platform.
