# 1. Server Side Rendering (SSR)

## Status

Accepted

## Context

The web was born as HTML, lately we fallback too often to JS as our default.
This makes pages slow, adds unnecessary load to the web and excludes users.
SSR is the least we can do to make sites easier to use, have less load on the
clients and deliver speed by default.

## Decision

Use SSR.

## Consequences

+ see above
- might be more work
