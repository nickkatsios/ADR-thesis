# 1. Use Bootstrap for styling

Date: 2020-04-05

## Status

Proposed

## Context

We would like to have an easy-to-use system for consistent styles that doesn't
take much tinkering. We propose using the `bootstrap` gem.

## Decision

Pending

## Consequences

Some familiarity with
[Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.4/getting-started/introduction/)
will likely be necessary but we hope the medium-to-long term benefits will
outweigh the cost to learn up front.
