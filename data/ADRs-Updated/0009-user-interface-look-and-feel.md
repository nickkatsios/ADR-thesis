# 9. User interface look and feel

Date: 2018-07-18

## Status

Accepted

## Context

We are building a new digital service for CCS.

[CCS-ADR-0002][ccs-adr-0002] says that all new services should have a common
user experience, based on the GOV.UK Design System.

These patterns should be amended to use the CCS colours and brand, but should
remain consistent with GOV.UK where possible.

## Decision

We will follow this CCS Architectural Decision and use the GOV.UK Design System
and GOV.UK Frontend, amended to use CCS colours and brand.

The service will be hosted on a subdomain of `crowncommercial.gov.uk`.

## Consequences

We will need to maintain the amendments as GOV.UK update their design patterns.
