# 3. Use Node.js and Express.js

Date: 2017-12-01

## Status

Accepted

## Context

Node.js acts as the server/backend for this project and Express.js is a simpler way to work with Node.js.

## Decision

We will use Node.js and Express.js as the server and backend framework for this project.

## Consequences

Express makes Node a bit easier and simpler to use; however, I won't be learning just Node. This is also in lieu of any other servers or frameworks that could be used.
