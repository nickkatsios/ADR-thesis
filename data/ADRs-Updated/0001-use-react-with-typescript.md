## Context and Problem Statement

We have to choose the framework and language to build this web application.
Which framework and language should we use?

## Considered Options

### Frameworks
* [React](https://reactjs.org/)
* [Vue](https://vuejs.org/)
* [Ember](https://emberjs.com/)

### Languages
* [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
* [JavaScript](https://www.javascript.com/)
* [Elm](https://elm-lang.org/)

## Decision Outcome

Chosen option: "React with Typescript", because

* The single developer has experience with React and Ember, but no experience with Vue
* This developer favors React over Ember, because he thinks the first contributes to a better separation of concerns
* This developer has experiece with TypeScript and JavaScript, but no experience with Elm
* This developer favors TypeScript mostly because it's typed.
