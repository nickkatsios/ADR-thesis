# Create Combat

### Status: completed

## Context: 

Need to create a basic structure for combat involving characters that know how to fight and a middle man referee that ensures that everyone gets a turn and works as a go between to ensure that the characters interact properly. This will create a basic means for the game to function.

## Decision: 

There should be a combat module specific to the characters and an overarching combat entity that handles the mediation.
