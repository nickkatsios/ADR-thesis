# 3. Move to Visual Studio 2017

Date: 2018-06-26

## Status

Accepted

## Context

Visual Studio 2017 has been released for roughly a year and includes improvements to C++ standards conformance. It is C++14
feature complete and has many C++17 features.

## Decision

As part of the maintenance cycle after release 3.13 we will move the Windows compilers forward to
Visual Studio 2017 in a step towards requiring C++14 as a minimum standard.

## Consequences

Windows developers will have access to all C++14 features.
