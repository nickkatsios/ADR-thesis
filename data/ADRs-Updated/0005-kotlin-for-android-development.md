Date: 2019-12-17

## Status

Accepted

## Context

- In the concept of start to implement the new application for mobile we chose new and modern technology
- For the long-term development we will have application with various functionality and cool feature
- Besides we plan to develop many other mobile application base on the first success application

### There are advantages

- Compatibility: It’s compatible with JDK 6, so older devices aren’t left behind.
- Performance: It’s on par with Java.
- Inter-operability: It’s 100% inoperable with Java including annotations.
- Footprint: The run-time library for Kotlin is tiny.
- Compilation Time: There’s a little overhead on clean builds but it’s way faster with incremental builds.
- Learning Curve: It’s easy to learn, especially for people used to modern languages. The Java to Kotlin converter in IntelliJ and Android Studio makes it even easier. You can also use a mix of Kotlin and Java in a project, so take your time learning Kotlin and add it in when you feel comfortable.
- Kotlin is supported and advertised by google, android editor

## Decision

We chose the Kotlin to develop the first android application, this is the way we keep the tech up to date for the longer target of development

## Consequences

The advantage of Kotlin language is easier to maintain and save time for development the android application. 
Keep up to date with technology is that key point to develop features application.
