# 4. Use Client Side Rendering (Create React App)

Date: 2019-02-06

## Status

Accepted

## Context

I need to decided if I use a SPA or a Server Side rendered app. This include performance and maintenance considerations.

## Decision

I use Client Side Rendering (Create React App).

## Consequences

it allows me to stick with the most standard starter tool and with Pre-Rendered CRA it addresses both the SEO and performance concerns around using CRA without the complexity that Next.js introduces, e.g, still can serve up the application as static files. See link below.
