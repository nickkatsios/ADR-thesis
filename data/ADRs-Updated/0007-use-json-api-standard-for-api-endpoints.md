# 7. Use JSON API standard for API endpoints

Date: 2018-06-18

## Status

Accepted

## Context

[ADR-0002][adr-0002] mentions the need to develop the API using well defined
JSON APIs.

It is good practice to adhere to a recognised open standard.

If there are well-maintained software libraries for serving APIs in a common
format, as well as the software which consumes them, then development time is
also reduced.

## Decision

We will use the [JSON API][JSON-API] when defining our API endpoints.

## Consequences

None
