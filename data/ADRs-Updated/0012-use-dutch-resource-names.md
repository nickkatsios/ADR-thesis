# 12. Use Dutch resource names.

Date: 2017-09-18

## Status

Accepted

## Context

When exposing API endpoints, exposing a UI or exposing resource field names, we have to decide on the language used. Do we cater to the majority of the world by using English, or do we use Dutch because we are creating resources for the Flemish Government?

## Decision

We will use Dutch terms because it is an external requirement dictated by the organisation.

## Consequences

We will possibly have to provide in a translation layer if we ever want to cater to a more international audience.
