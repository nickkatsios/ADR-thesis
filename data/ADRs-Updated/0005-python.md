# 5. Python

Date: 2017-11-11

## Status

Accepted

## Context

We need to choose main programming language for this project.

## Decision

I'm now fluent in writing Python and JavaScript. Both languages are widely used  
these days and may attract developers to join this project.

Python is more mature with more stable libs for writing server side code and  
testing. JS may have better libraries for writing GraphQL APIs because  
GraphQL originated in JS ecosystem.

I'm doing this in free time and for fun. I want to focus on project's features  
and not to waste a time with poorly designed language lacking mature and  
stable libraries. So for obvious reasons I'm choosing Python.

## Consequences

* Some people will love this decision.
* Some people will hate this decision.
