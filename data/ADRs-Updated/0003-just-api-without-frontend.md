# 3. Just API without frontend

Date: 2017-11-11

## Status

Accepted

## Context

Open Lobby must have open stable API.

## Decision

Open Lobby will be server just with an API based on API First design. Frontend  
will be written as separate application (web based, mobile, ...). This will  
ensure that there is a working API for anything that frontend application(s)  
will do.

## Consequences

Extra work with API layer capable of everything.
