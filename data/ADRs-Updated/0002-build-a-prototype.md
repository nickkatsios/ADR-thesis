# 2. Build a prototype

Date: 01/06/2017

## Status

Pending

## Context

We need to make sure that whatever we build meets the users' needs. To make sure of this we need to
conduct some user research, which should involve putting software in front of users and observing them using it.

## Decision

We will build a simple "prototype" which we will use to test our assumptions about whether our proposed
solution is the best way of meeting our users needs.

The prototype will be architecturally similar to the product we envisage building, but won't be able to
do the SAML interactions with Verify at this stage.

ADRs for the first prototype will live in the [prototype-0](prototype-0) directory.

## Consequences

We will have a prototype which we can use for user research.
