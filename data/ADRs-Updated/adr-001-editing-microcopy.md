We will follow the [example set in the Content Publisher](https://github.com/alphagov/content-publisher/blob/master/docs/adr/0004-editing-microcopy.md) for how to allow Content Designers to edit microcopy in the app. This is for consistency and lower context switching for content designers working on both the Content Publisher and the Content Data App.
