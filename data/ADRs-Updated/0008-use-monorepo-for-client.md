# 8. Use monorepo for client

Date: 2018-05-16

## Status

Accepted

## Context

Development in health-modules often requires tandem work in openchs-android as well. It is much easier to have them in a single repo for ease of development. The repos will be set up using Lerna. 

## Decision

All client side libraries will be set up as a monorepo using Lerna. 

## Consequences
