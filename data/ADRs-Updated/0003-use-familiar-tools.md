Relates to [2. Use Node.js](0002-use-node-js.md)

Leads to [4. Use Jasmine for unit testing](0004-use-jasmine-for-unit-testing.md)

Leads to [6. Use ESLint for linting](0006-use-eslint-for-linting.md)

Guides [8. Use TypeScript](0008-use-typescript.md)

## Context

As described in [2. Use Node.js](0002-use-node-js.md), the goal is to make
reasonable choices without taking too much time.

## Decision

Use familiar tools whenever possible.

## Consequences

 - I won't need to make a full assessment of alternatives like I would for a
   long-lasting project
    - So I can move faster
 - The tools I choose might not be a perfect fit for this task, and that's OK
