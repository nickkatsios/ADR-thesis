## Context and Problem Statement

Users writing programs to issue user jwt, ask if this can be done in **languages other than go**.
We assume that these programs stamp out a set number of identical user profiles.

With the addition of scoped signing keys, limits and permissions are **attached to the signing key instead of the user**.
As a consequence, user jwt generating programs, do not need the data model the jwt library provides.
The use of scoped signing keys is highly encouraged as a compromised key can only be used to issue certain user, NOT user with arbitrary permissions.

Thus, a simple utility function, added to nkey supporting client libraries, can replace the need for the go only jwt library, for most use cases.

> This can be a series of standalone repositories as well. 
> Because this is a single and small utility function, adding it to suitable client libraries seems easiest for usage as it meets the users where they are (similar to nkey functions in some languages).
> Furthermore, this may not be needed for every client library. 
> Initially we'd focus on languages widely used by corporate user where jwt generating programs are to be expected.
> Those would be: `go`, `java`, `csharp`

## References

This is going to be a much simplified version of this [c# example](https://docs.nats.io/developing-with-nats/tutorials/jwt#stamping-jwt-in-languages-other-than-go).
Instead of the [go jwt library](https://github.com/nats-io/jwt) with the full data model, `sprintf` is used with very few values.
Any library implementing this will require basic `nkey` functions to `sign` and `generate` new nkeys.
`sign` will exist in every library supporting nkeys. 
Generating new nkeys is a matter of base64url random bytes, base64url encoding and decorating them.

## Design

The proposed function is supposed to only set values that are not covered by the scoped signing key.
These values are `name`, `expiration`, `account id`, `tags`.
The `user nkey` can be generated by the signer or a requestor can provide it so the signer is unaware of the private nkey portion.
So that the user can generate nkeys when not provided, the functionality to generate a user nkey needs to be public as well. 

Proposed name and function signature:
```
/**
 * signingKey, is a mandatory account nkey pair to sign the generated jwt.
 * accountId, is a mandatory public account nkey. Will return error when not set or not account nkey.
 * publicUserKey, is a mandatory public user nkey. Will return error when not set or not user nkey.
 * name, optional human readable name. When absent, default to publicUserKey.
 * expiration, optional but recommended duration, when the generated jwt needs to expire. If not set, JWT will not expire.
 * tags, optional list of tags to be included in the JWT.
 *
 * Returns:
 * error, when issues arose.
 * string, resulting jwt. 
 **/
IssueUserJWT(signingKey nkey, accountId string, publicUserKey string, name string, expiration time.Duration, tags []string) (error, string)
```

Static header json:
```go
{"typ":"JWT","alg":"ed25519-nkey"}
```

Commented body (//) json output that is subsequently turned into a jwt (treat not commented values as static):
```go
{
 // expiration (when specified) time in unix seconds, derived from provided duration.
 "exp": 1632077055,
 // issue time in unix seconds. Will always need to be set.
 "iat": 1626720255,
 // public nkey portion of signingKey 
 "iss": "AACYICOAQMQ72EHT35R7LV6VFWMIVWFKWFE5P2JJ2TT674EO7DJTUHMM",
 // unique implementation dependent value 
 // our jwt library uses base32 encoded sha256 hash of this json with "jti":""
 "jti": "FRQCL7TPAIL6KHKPPPJS2YOHTANKNHTPLTX7STGPTGYZVGTOH2LQ",
 // name provided or value of publicUserKey
 "name": "USER_NAME",
 "nats": {
  // value of accountId 
  "issuer_account": "ADECCNBUEBWZ727OMBFSN7OMK2FPYRM52TJS25TFQWYS76NPOJBN3KU4",
  // tags, omit fully when not provided
  "tags": [
   "provided_tag1",
   "provided_tag2"
  ],
  "type": "user",
  "version": 2
 },
 // public nkey portion of signingKey  
 "sub": "UD44C3VDAEYG527W3VPY353B3C6LIWJNW77GJED7MM5WIPGRUEVPHRZ5"
}
```
The `jti` can be a random value. If possibly, we should compute it the same way the jwt library does:
1) The body is first generated with `jti` set to `""`. 
2) Then the `jti` value is computed as base32 encoded sha256 hash of the body.
3) Then the body is generated again, this time with the correct `jti`. 

Both the static header json as well as the body are then base64url encoded.
Please note that base64url is slightly different than base64. 
Padding characters `=` are removed and `+` is changed to `-` and `/` is changed to `_`. 
Compute the signature using signingKey over the following string (The dot is included as per jwt specification):
```go
base64url-header + "." + base64url-body
```

Encode the signature with base64url, concatenate and return the resulting token:
```go
base64url-header + "." + base64url-body + "." + base64url-signature
```

## Consequences

Remove the need for the jwt library when programmatically generating user jwt using scoped signing keys.

## Scoped Signing Key Setup for Development

These commands generate an account named ACC, generate and add a signing key to it, and promote the generated signing key to a scoped one with an arbitrary role name for easier referencing, issue the next commands:
```bash
> nsc add account -n ACC
> nsc edit account --name ACC --sk generate
> nsc edit signing-key --account ACC --sk <key output in previous command> --role anyrolename <any limit/permissions option you want>
```

To add a user with values similar to the earlier json body and sign it with the scoped signing key and output the json, execute:
```bash
> nsc add user --account ACC --name USER_NAME --tag PROVIDED_TAG1 --tag PROVIDED_TAG2  --expiry 2h --private-key anyrolename
> nsc describe user --account ACC --name USER_NAME --json
```

An invocation of the utility function, generating a similar user would look like this:
```go
IssueUserJWT(accSigningKey, "ADECCNBUEBWZ727OMBFSN7OMK2FPYRM52TJS25TFQWYS76NPOJBN3KU4", "UD44C3VDAEYG527W3VPY353B3C6LIWJNW77GJED7MM5WIPGRUEVPHRZ5", "USER_NAME", 2*time.Hour, []string{"PROVIDED_TAG1", "PROVIDED_TAG2})
```
