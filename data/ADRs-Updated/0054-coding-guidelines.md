Date: 2020-09-21

## Status

Accepted

Implements [4. Create software defined everything](0004-create-software-defined-everything.md)

## Context

Coding conventions are a set of guidelines for a specific programming language that recommend programming style, practices, and methods for each aspect of a program written in that language. These conventions usually cover file organization, indentation, comments, declarations, statements, white space, naming conventions, programming practices, programming principles, programming rules of thumb, architectural best practices, etc. These are guidelines for software structural quality. Software programmers are highly recommended to follow these guidelines to help improve the readability of their source code and make software maintenance easier.

Coding guidelines result in enhanced efficiency, reduced risk, mininized complexity, maintainability, bug rectification, comprehensive look and cost efficiency.

## Decision

We will use coding guidelines for all languages used on the platform.

## Consequences

Coding guidelines have to be defined, learned and maintained. However, a lot of common standardized coding guidelines exist, coming with tools to simplify implementation.
