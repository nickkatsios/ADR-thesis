## ADR 1: Adopting Architecture Decision Records
July 25, 2019

### Context
Although Phase II of the touch table app is complete, there was insufficient documentation of the development process. This includes explanations of code choices, architecture, and setup as well as the pros and cons of using certain technologies. In order for the U!Scientist app to have more longevity and guide the development of future touch table applications, there should be more descriptive documentation to provide guidance for future development.

These ADRs are inspired by [this blog post](http://thinkrelevance.com/blog/2011/11/15/documenting-architecture-decisions). Although usually written in concert with development, these ADRs are written after completed development.

### Decision
ADRs should be used to outline the app structure, conventions, and technology choices by using the outline provided in the linked blog post above.

### Status
Accepted

### Consequences
Adopting this approach should help future developers wishing to contribute to the project or wanting to create their own touch table application.

**Note**: Although not mentioned in the ADR blog post, I will be adding an "in retrospect" section to each ADR reflecting on the lessons learned with each implementation.
