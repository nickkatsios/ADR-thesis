# 3. Drive development with TDD

Date: 2020-06-29

## Status

Accepted

## Context

The goal of this project is to build out a small, demonstration CQRS and Event Sourced application. 
Test Driven Development is an excellent way to keep the development cycle short and on track whilst naturally keeping test coverage high.
This project is also a learning tool that is helping me get familiar with the Go programming language.    

## Decision

Allow the tests to drive the development of this application.

## Consequences

A TDD approach should reduce the risks of working on any project, so I don't expect any undesirable consequences.
