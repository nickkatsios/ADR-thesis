##Issue: 
We want to keep track of any project that may be interesting for microfrontend services.
 In order to do so we will add these projects as a modules to our repo

##Decision:
Add any external repo as a dependence.
All the github repos will bre fork and host under "microfrontends-compendium" github organization


##Status:
 Approved

##Group:
 Structural organization

##Assumptions:
 All repos must be public and in github

##Constraints:
 

##Positions:
We may think that maybe not all the projects are important so we planned to include the projects as references in case some one decided not to download all projects.
Also having forked the repos will give us the opportunity to update those project or to stay as they were at the time of inclusion   
 
##Argument:
To have a record of other projects that are trying to include microfrontends. Having all the project togetter will give us a better view of all of them
 
##Implications:
 Adding other repos as forks of "microfrontends-compendium" github organization and updating package.json
