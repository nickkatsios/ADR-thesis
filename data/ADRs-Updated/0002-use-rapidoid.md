(Added retroactively)

## Status

Superceded by [3. Switch to Spring Boot](0003-switch-to-spring-boot.md)

## Context

This project is being developed as a technology demonstrator. During my day job, we use Spring Boot for almost all of our REST services. I have been exploring several micro frameworks, and for this project I chose to look at [Rapidoid](https://www.rapidoid.org/).

## Decision

Use Rapidoid for this experiment.

## Consequences

This will be a different framework than I normally use. There will be many learnings.

Given the small nature of this experiment, it may not fully exercise this framework.
