# 2. Use a single machine

Date: 20/02/2016

## Status

Accepted

## Context

Multiple machines add a bunch of complexity - we don't want to deal with that while we're experimenting with how this
actually works. The advantages of microservices are pretty minimal for a 1 person team.

## Decision

1. Put server logic on 1 machine

## Consequences
