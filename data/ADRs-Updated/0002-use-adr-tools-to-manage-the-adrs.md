# 2. Use adr-tools to manage the ADRs

Date: 2020-06-29

## Status

Accepted

## Context

A tool to make creating these ADRs helps reduce friction around creating documentation.  

`adr-tools` is a simple cli tool that has been used in the past on previous projects to great effect (https://github.com/npryce/adr-tools)   

## Decision

Install `adr-tools` locally and use it to help quickly generate consistent ADRs

## Consequences

ADRs are pretty easy to create manually, so a tool isn't really necessary but with the tool they are trivial to create.  
There aren't really any risks to this.
