# 2. Content Syndication

Date: 2019-03-08

## Status

Proposed

## Context

PHE would like to syndicate Talk To Frank content for use internally, across NHS digital & third party platforms.  
News, Drug content & warnings could be especially useful for other content providers.  

The syndication API will adhere to GDS [API technical and data standards](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/gds-api-technical-and-data-standard).

Options considered:

1. Leverage existing Contentful API
2. Create an API gateway to Contentful API
3. Integrate with NHS Digital Syndication platform
