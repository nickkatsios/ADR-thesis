Decision Template
=================

Background
----------

The background section should contain the background information needed for
understanding what is being decided.
This is not supposed to be a burden to write or read, 1-2 paragraphs should be
enough.

If the decision changes the way we do something, please mention this here and
describe the current way either here or in the "Other options" section.

Problem/Questions
-----------------

What is/are the issue(s) on which we need a decision? Consider adding examples,
either here or in a separate section. Consider separating multiple issues
in multiple documents.

Decision: Decision title 1
--------------------------

If there is only one decision (which should usually be the case), having
just "Decision" as the section title is reasonable.

Decision: Decision title 2
--------------------------

Multiple decisions, by default, should be separated in multiple sections, each
having hints in its title about what is being decided.

Reasoning/Other options considered
----------------------------------

Why did we decide the way we did? What other options were considered?

Other useful information. Examples:
* This was a top-down decision, please ask `<someone>` for details
* See this Slack thread for the discussion that lead to this decision
  (but this should not be used instead of listing the actual reasons here).

This section may be missing, but, by default, please add information here. It
will help all future readers understand the decision and it will prevent people
from rejecting it and re-deciding on something worse.
