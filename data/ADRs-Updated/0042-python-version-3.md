# 42. Python version 3

Date: 2020-09-21

## Status

Accepted

Implements [4. Create software defined everything](0004-create-software-defined-everything.md)

## Context

In the past, there was a bit of a debate in the coding community about which Python version was the best one to learn: Python 2 vs Python 3 (or, specifically, Python 2.7 vs 3.5). Now, it's more of a no-brainer: Python 3 is the clear winner.

## Decision

We will use python3  exclusively for all our python code. 

Make sure you use version active maintained version (currently 3.6 or higher)

## Consequences

[Python active version](https://www.python.org/downloads/release)
