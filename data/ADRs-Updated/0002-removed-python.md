# Moved to a website

## Context and Problem Statement

Current tech stack is very complicated and requires users to download a tool to use it. It takes away from the main idea of this project.

## Decision Drivers

* sql.js is a library that allows opening up an SQLite database on the website
* desktop applciation stack with Python backend is complciated

## Considered Options

## Decision Outcome

Dropped the backend/frontend solution. Moved to a pure website.

### Positive Consequences

* Easier to use - just open a website, upload a file and use the results.
* Less complex tech stack.

### Negative Consequences

* Launching games, and other advanded features are out of scope.
