# Create Castable Spells

### Status: accepted

## Context: 

Want to give more variation to the combat system beyond physical attacks. This will allow for reasons to create separate builds and more options for player characters and enemies to use during a fight. This will give more of a *game* element to the combat as opposite to a system based on luck alone.

## Decision: 

Create spells and integrate them into the character and combat systems.

## Progress:

* Damage spells, both aoe and single target added
* Healing spells, aoe, self, ally, any target added.
