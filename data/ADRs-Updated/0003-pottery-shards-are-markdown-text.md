# 3. Pottery "shards" are Markdown text

Date: 2018-08-17

## Status

Accepted

## Context

Each event recorded by Pottery (aka "shard") is a short piece of text.  Maybe with links, or basic formatting.

Pottery is used on the command line, so shards need to be generated by Unix command line tools, readable on the terminal and edited in a text editor.

## Decision

The content of each shard will be in Markdown format.

## Consequences

Shards are easy to generate and edit.

Shards can be read on the command line.

Existing Markdown processors can be used to generate more presentable views of the project history.

Metadata can be included in the file in YAML format, if needed.
