# 1. Record architecture decisions

Date: 2020-05-09

## Status

Accepted

## Context

We need to record the architectural decisions made on this project. Not all decisions will be made at once, nor will all of them be done when the project begins. Most developers have been on at least one project where the specification document was larger (in bytes) than the total source code size. Those documents are too large to open, read, or update. Bite-sized pieces are easier for all stakeholders to consume.

## Decision

We will use Architecture Decision Records, as [captured on ThoughtWorks technology radar](https://www.thoughtworks.com/radar/techniques/lightweight-architecture-decision-records).
