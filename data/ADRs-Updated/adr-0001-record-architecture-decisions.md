# ADR 0001: Record architecture decisions

Date: 2018-09-30

## Status

Accepted

## Context

I want to be able to remember the reason I chose a particular architecture so I can change my mind!

I also hope the records will be useful to others trying to understand how someone might approach
creating a game in Haskell.

Normally I would use this style for a team codebase, but I'm hoping the approach will have value
even though this is a solo project.

Also I like architecture decision records and want more projects to use them, so let's lead by
example!

## Decision

I will use Architecture Decision Records, as described by Michael Nygard in this article: http://thinkrelevance.com/blog/2011/11/15/documenting-architecture-decisions

## Consequences

- If I make a decision of consequence. I'll write an ADR outlining why I made that decision.
- See Michael Nygard's article, linked above, for further consequences of this approach.
